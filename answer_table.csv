1,1,Yes,DAI475
1,1.a,We need to do a calc to figure out HER2+ 2L patients. But  in FR we have about 6500 patients diagnosed with GC each year and 50-60% have aGC and we know among this pop of patients we have 15 -70% with gastric adenocarcinoma. Among these patients approx. 50% can receive a 2nd line treatment and only 20-30% can receive 3rd line treatment. Based on this info you can make a calc of the number of 2L and 3L HER2 positive patients. Iâ€™m a little surprised about Italy. The population of IT I don't know if bigger than FR because we have 60 mil individuals in FR and I dont know about Italy so Iâ€™m a bit surprised. [67 million in FR and 60mil in Italy population].,DAI475

1,2.c,"[clarifying clinical burden] I think its logical the patient as an advanced disease the more the problem worsens and the quality of life gets bad â€“ so the more advanced, the higher the clinical burden. [anything symptom-wise you would pull out as relevant here?] in the first line treatment the objective is disease control and improving the survival. The more the disease progresses, the priority becomes QoL and symptoms and not really the survival. QoL is very important for patients in 3rd line treatment and survival more important in 1L treatment.",DAI475
1,3.a,"3,4,5",DAI475
1,3.c,In FR we donâ€™t look at price of the drugs. We look at the drugs we have and treat with those,DAI475
1,4,4,DAI475
1,4.b,"I am the coordinator of the FR guidelines for management of patients with GC. When you look at the FR guidelines, they are almost the same as ESMO. The therapeutic strategy is identical. We look at HER2 status. For HER2+ GC we treat people with doublet chemotherapy and combined with pyrimidine and platinum salts in addition to trastuzumab. For patients with HER2 negative GC we use chemotherapy and nivolumab if the tumor is CPS higher than 5 - This is for 1L. We have the results of the spotlight trial which has been communicated at ASCO GI meeting last week showing that patients with overexpression of claudin 18.2, they may benefit from zolbetixumab with FOLFOX6, that awas the pop with HER2 negative tumors. This means over the next months we will decide on best marker between claudin and CPS and best drug for these patients. This is for 1L treatment. In 2nd line treatment we have ramucirumab alone or in combo with paclitaxel. Even if approved by EU, not reimbursed in FR so difficult to use so we use chemo mostly. We also have pembro in 2nd line for pts with MSI-high GC that have nt been treated with nivo in 1L . We got approval from EMA but MoH say pembro (keytruda) wonâ€™t be reimbursed in FR for MSI-H patients. [seems like from 2nd line on taxane and irino reimbursed in FR?] yes but not ramu or pembro wont be reimbursed.",DAI475
1,4.b.i,"3L we have trifluri also, which is the only drug which proved efficacy in ph3 RCT. We can use chemo, taxane or irino if the drug not been used previously but no strong efficacy for these drugs because no RCT testing chemo in 3L or later. We have the trial in 2L but not 3L. But it is a therapeutic option. In Asian countries have nivo for patients with CPS higher than 1 with PDL1+ cancer but not in EU or US. No difference in FR guidelines compared to ESMO. In US we have approval of Enhertu in 2L her+ advanced gastric cancer. We have early access to Enhertu in FR for patients with HER2+ aGC in 3L treatment since July 2023. We also have the approval from EMA in Dec 2022 for Enhertu in 2nd line treatment based on Destiny Gastric 01 and 02 trials.",DAI475
1,4.c,"For pembro (keytruda), the recommendation not strong enough as based on cohort studies, not randomized trial. If you look at clinical survival evidence, shows pembro is probably the most important drug we have seen for decades in G.I cancer. Difficult to make RCT phase 3 trial. The agencies need RCTs but we know MSI-H patients is a small subgroup of patients so complicated to make ph3 RCT. Texane and irinotecan in 3L reccommendation not strong enough, it's only option. Nivo is approved in US for all patients no matter the CPS but EU only for CPS higher than 5. Also in US pembro approved for HER2 for 1L in combo with trastuzumab and chemo.",DAI475
1,5.a,"4,4,4",DAI475
1,5.c,"Personalised medicine I think will come for gastric. Look at markers and make a molecular profile of tumours. Need to look at HER2, CPS, MSI, unmet need also is for HER2+ population, we do not have as in BC many drugs proved effective. Only trastuzumab and maybe Enhertu being tested in phase 3 trial but we have only data from phase 2 trial and we have seen a lot of negative trials testing different anti-HER2 agents that have failed to demonstrate survival benefit. There is a real unmet need in HER2+ GC.",DAI475
1,9,"There are a lot of drugs currently tested in her2pos GC. We have tucatinib, very promising drug. Enhertu currently tested in ph3 trial. We have many other drugs. We also have maditruximab which is an antiher2 monoclonal antibody. Activates ADCC strongly, currently tested in 1L treatment in combo with immunotherapy. We also have zenidatamab, a B-specific mAB - currently testing in combination with immunotherapy. We have a lot of anti her2 that are currently tested in combination with immunotherapy. We have many ADCs and B-specific antibodies. Very challenging and exciting to see how many trials are conducted in this patient pop.",DAI475
1,10.a,"When I see this design. Itâ€™s the same design as destiny gastric 01 and 02. Whats strange is ORR, trial A is 50% and B is 40% even though the patients in trial A are more pre-treated. The more of the disease is advanced and harder to get ORR, not logical to try to reach ORR of 40% in 2L and 50% in 3L and later. I don't know if you understand [I understand, you expect ORR to be lower in 3L]. Same for OS for these two pops. I guess patients in 2L will have a better mOS than patients in 3L. [in terms of values themselves, how do you perceive these?] very relevant to have this objective. We know patients in 2L treatment with chemo it's between 3-5 months of mOS except for pacli and ramu which is higher with 7-9 months mOS so 12 months is very ambitious but very relevant for this population of patients. For ORR, also very unperceived to have 40-50%, we usually have this in 1L patients. To have this in patients heavily treated is highly impressive",DAI475
1,11.c,"For the biggest study its 200 patients from Asian pop and smaller is 100 patients US and EU. I think easier to launch trials in Asian pops as incidence and prevalence higher there so I think thatâ€™s why. I think the recruitment is better that's why. I think if you look at characteristics of patients in osophagyeal or GI cancer trials most come from Asian countries. Also important to test in non-Asian pops because some drugs, the efficacy could be different between Asian and non-Asian so important to confirm in non-Asian [so you would want results confirmed in Western pop?] yes. [thoughts on comparator?]for the comparator I think in 3L treatment these are good therapeutic options but the level of the recc is not as strong as the (trifluridine tipiracil - lonsurf) recommended therapy which is the drug that has really been tested in 3L RCT therapy. [Is pacli/irino only used if not used in 2L? If irino used in 2L maybe some 3L patients not eligible?] You have to use taxane if patient treated with irino in 2nd line.",DAI475
1,12.b,Better to have a randomized trial. If you have RCT in Asian pop and have results and want to confirm in non-Asian popthen makes sense to have a single arm. Always better to have a randomized trial but if want to confirm in a different population it would be nice to have this kind of study. Always nice to have a RCT when you want to demonstrate something. ,DAI475
1,12.b.i,[What would you want the comparator to be in 2L?] Tacsil and ramucirumab [even if not reimbursed in FR?] When you include patient in randomised trial will receive taxil ramu because it's provided by the clinical trial,DAI475
1,13,"Iâ€™m  a bit concerned about the pneumonitis. I want to know what are the MoA of this drug [ADC] we know with Enhertu we have approx. this % of ILD and we know we have to follow the patients closely and do a CT scan every 6 months and stop the drug if we have grade 1 ILD and start corticosteroid. You have to make the balance, clinical benefit vs risk of adverse event. Patients with aGC the prognosis is really bad. The ORR and survival results here the risk of AEs vs the clinical and survival benefit of this drug I would go for this drug but inform the physician and patient that the AE is possible and follow patient closely and stop the treatment early in case of AE.",DAI475
1,15,[any additional evidence not included?] Itâ€™s also important to have QoL for these patients treated in 3L and later lines. And to compare QoL for 3L treatment thatâ€™s the only thing lacking,DAI475
1,16.a.i,[theres a chance this product might be 2L or later indication by EMA] 3.5,DAI475
1,16.b.i,I expected higher response rate and mOS for 2nd line treatment so between 3 and 4,DAI475
1,16.c.i,"4, not 5 because not RCT, small study. Even if complicated to perform these kind of studies and in 3L we only have 20% of patients that are able to receive 3L treatment and HER2 is 15-20% so very  hard work but we need a larger ph3 RCT to confirm this data. This is why I will not go for 5 but for 4",DAI475
2,1,"yes (from WS) --- These numbers are a bit difficult for one physician in one town to know. I could tell you the percentage but I would have to calculate, I don't know the actual number. I don't know how you got the number of 500 per year. I know in Germany there are about, let's see. We are speaking about 2L HER2-positive GC. 2L and 3L. We have about 15,000 new cases of gastric cancer in Germany every year. [any type]? yes, any type of gastric cancer. Then probably metastatic are half of them let's guess. So that would be 7,000. And of the 7,000 around 15% are HER2-positive. About 1000 will be HER2-positive. From these around 800 will get 1L treatment and from the 800 50% will get a 2L treatment. So you are not so wrong. It is about this figure. I don't know how you got 484 but it roughly is about this range.",DAI475
2,1.a,ok (from WS),DAI475
2,2,"For now we didn't look if the patients in 2L were HER2 + or - as up to now it didn't matter. 2L treatment, we know that we have different options for 2L. We have chemotherapy vs best supportive care and we know that ChT is extending survival and prolonging a good quality of life. There are different options. The standard of care is paclitaxel-ramucirumab which is an active and moderately tolerable regimen. [soc?] Yes, it is the best investigated regimen but irinotecan and docetaxel are also investigated and can also be given. These guidelines we always quote these 3 drugs. But of course the response rate range around 20-25% which is not very good. So there is a high medical need of something better. But on the other hand it has to be well tolerated because in GC the patients deteriorate quite quickly and often in 2L the health status is not so good anymore. [3L?] In 3L officially we have this drug called Lonsurf, tipiracil-trifluridine, which is an oral component and is proven to be better than best supportive care. In Asia there is nivolumab registered but not in Europe and at the last ASCO GI conference there was regorafenib, trial Infinity I think it was called, I am not sure about the name. It was an Italian trial with regorafenib. No it is wrong. It is Integrate, Interate 2 was the name of the trial, an Australian trial. And it showed that regorafenib in 3L was improving survival compared to BSC.",DAI475
2,2.a,"3,4,2",DAI475
2,2.c,"The tumour given them fatigue, nausea, peritoneal carcinomatosis is a big problem and there are theories that peritoneal carcinomatosis is not responding so well to systemic chemotherapy because there is a barrier. The ChT is not reaching out to the peritoneal ceilings. These are the main problems.",DAI475
2,3.a,"4,3,2",DAI475
2,4,2,DAI475
2,4.a,"Yes that is sort of correct, that is all I said. [to paraphrase what you said so far: cyramza + paclitaxel sometimes docetaxel in 2L, and in 3L ?] or Irinotecan, and in 3L we would then give either the one we didn't give in 2L, so if we gave rampac in 2L we have irinotecan for 3L or if we gave irinotecan in 2L then we have rampac in 3L. Or we have ... [why cyramza 3L] Because sometimes patients have polyneuropathy after oxalitplatin, wich is the ususla component we give in 1L and if you have polyneuropathy already then paclitaxel is not the best drug because it increases the neuropathies. Sometimes you wait until the oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy gets better and you keep taxanes for later. And another thing is that we give in 1L in a patient which has a high need of remission we give a triple ChT in 1L, the so-called FLOT regimen with ...?? (9:015) oxaliplatin and docetaxel. If they had already FLOT so a taxane in 1L you won't give paclitaxel in 2L so easily.",DAI475
2,4.c,"Well that is what I said. Taxane limitation is polyneuropathy and pretreatment with other taxane. Ramucirumab limitation is fistula formation, and bleeding and thrombosis. Irinotecan limitation is diarrhea and liver funtion. [when you think about new products, what is it that you would like?] Well tolerated and better activity, easy to say.",DAI475
2,5.a,"4,4,3",DAI475
2,5.e,"[oncogenic drivers, not targeted right now, could become more sophistocate, in gatsric not as many drivers discovered] There are more and more drivers discovered in gastric cancer. There is Claudin18.2 which is now getting important for 1L treatment. There was a big trial which just ahd a positive OS benefit. There is FGFR2B overexpression with bevacituzumab(?) as a potential drug which is investigated in Ph3 studies so there are new markers as well. And in 2L - this is probably what you are aiming at - HER2 positivity is also relevant in 2L perhaps.",DAI475
2,6,Tucatinib I know that there are trials ongoing in GC as well combined tocatinib with trastuzumab and other drugs as well. And of course trastuzumab deruxtecan is well know which is registered from 22nd of December. We all have to get experience with this drug. Everyone is a bit worries with the pulmonary side effects which have been reported in some percept of patients but we have to get experience how frequent this really is. The other drugs I was not so much aware of.,DAI475
2,7,"I think trastuzumab deruxtecan everybody will try it. But in the trials it was compared to investgator's choice, there wasn't really a real H2H with paclitaxel ramucirumab. [prefer rampac comparison?] Well if I may quote you it is the SoC in 2L. As far as I remember it was only compared to paclitaxel monotherapy which is a good choice but paclitaxel ramucirumab was better than paclitaxel monotherapy. So heoretically we don't which is better but for clinical practice it doesn't matter because we can use one first and then the other or the other way around. And we don't know if it is important to retest for HER2-positivity.",DAI475
2,10,"It looks a little bit like trastuzumab deruxtecan with this interstitial lung disease and the frequency of 10%. The response rate is very high with 50% ORR in Asian population in 3L setting that is really unbelievably high. We would ask how these patients were pretreated. Most have a fluropyrimidine agent and platin agent. Well I guess most get paclitaxel in 2L, rampac probably not because it was investigator's choice to give paclitaxel in 3L. Anyway it is a high response and a very very long mOS of 12.5mo. This is really long ecause this is sort of the range we have for 1L treatment. We have a range of 12 mo OS. So here for 3L 12 mo they should be highly selected patients. Only the fittest of the fittest who are included in the trial. Usually the European patients in the 3L setting if they have been pretreated with oxaliplatin-5-FU and paclitaxel ramucirumab in 3L setting they have a median survival of 3 mo and not 12 mo. This is a highly selected group.",DAI475
2,11.b,"[you mentioned earlier you wanted the comparison with ramucirumab] this was for 2L, but here in 3L you don't need to compare it to ramucirumab. Theoretically patients should be pretreated with oxaliplatin-5-FU and perhaps paclitaxel-ramucirumab. And in 3L you can compare it to irinotecan. it is okay how it is designed but it would be even fairer if they were all pretreated with paclitaxel-ramucirumab. And in Asian population the survival is often much much longer and often they give only a single Asian treatment as palliative treatment so it is different whether they got platin-5-FU in a combination or they first got only monotherapy of 5-FU or S1 and then monotherapy of platinum, that is important to know.",DAI475
2,11.c,"It is a long debate whether it is the same sort of disease because they often have a much longer survival as I said. And it is difficult, usually data from an Asian only population is not so easily transferable to a Caucasian population. [you donâ€™t think it is] no, for registration purposes it is not enough anyways, and even for physicians if there are no Caucasian patients included and we wouldn't have data for caucasian patients it is a bit difficult. but that is why you have trial B. [basline characteristics are the smae, same prior therapy, simialr outcomes, what do you think of that argument] trial B is only a 2L treatment because ususally as I said in Europe and the US they get a combination treatment before but it is okay. It sort of looks like the DESTINY01 and 02 trials. It is convincing that the response rate is very very high, as I said it is a very selected group but the drug seems to be very active anyway. And probably in real life the response rate will be a little bit less but we obviously have a very active drug. [you would still use it] yes.",DAI475
2,12.b,"It's SAT, it reminds me of the DESTINY-02. There it wsa only 79 patients as I remember and not 100. It is confirmatory that it is an active drug also in Caucasians and as you said it is not much different the response rate from an Asian population so it is very unlikeley that there is a real difference between those 2 groups. It is a very important piece of information.",DAI475
2,13,"This interstitial lung disease is a bit worrying and from the DESTINY-02 trial, if it would be this there were 2 patients dying from 79. Here it says 10% pneumonitis, there are no deaths reported in trial B, I donâ€™t know. We don't know whether it is Dxd. we need to get experience with the drug. In breast cancer it is already in use but not so many people have so good experience with it.",DAI475
2,13.a,"The side effects of pneumonitis the incidence is low. We would just hope for our patients that they don't get it and for prescribing it is more important important how it is tolerated in general life. That it is not so much giving you nausea, vomoting, diarrhea, and these other things all the other ChT do, and fatigue. And if this is less and here it seems to be otherwise quite well tolerated then the 10% of pneumonitis is severe but we would jut hope it doesn't happen and it wouldn't affect our attempt to use the drug.",DAI475
2,14.a,"I don't know, if you talk about the DESTINY trials it was just the other way around. So you are saying DESTINY-02 was first and 01 is supportive. [clarifying question again] Yes I know what you are saying but the historical way was different. The trial A was first and the trial B was later but I would say it is easier to get registration at the EMA with a randomised trial and argue that there is no difference between Asians and Caucasians and use trial B as support for this argument that there is no difference. I think this is more logical than the other way around, than to say with this pivotal trial, non-randomised SAT trial we want to get our registration for Europe and use a randomised trial to support this claim. I think that is not so promising. I think in Europe as far as I know they dont give registration, different from the US, for a non-randomised trial so you would need the randomised trial to hope for regitration and use the trial b to support that there is no difference between Asians and Caucasians.",DAI475
2,14.a.ii,"No no I just said that trial A is important. I just said the opposite, I just said that you only have a chance for registration if you put all your emphasis on a randomised controlled trial.",DAI475
2,15,"[trial c] well that is the trial we were just talking about. [yes exaclty so what do you think now?] well it would be a very good trial idea, it would answer all our questions. But it is difficult as I said to get this tial filled, perhaps only in Eastern bloc countries where they don't have access to product X. If it is the trial I am thinking about, in some trials they recommend rebiopsy of the tumour to test if the tumour is still HER2  positive. the registration now you don't need to retest the tumour, her2-positiviy in the primary tumour is enough but in some trials they want rebiopsy. and this makes it even more difficult to fill the trial if you have to rebiopsy the patient first. [when required ususally 2L to 3L?] No between 1L and 2L. [if drug launched on basis of trial A and B but you knew trial C would be available, would use in 2L or wait for trial C finish] I think many of us would use it I would say in 2L or 3L. The trial c is scientifically very valuable but it is dead.",DAI475

2,16.c.i,3,DAI475
2,16.d,"Well everything I said before. The comparator arm is, The one trial A is Asian and highly selected and with survival data I have never seen before in any 3L trial so it shows that it is a highly highly selected population. And the same is for trial B, trial b is a non-randomised trial and also a highly selected population obviously. So it is very promising but so far I would say it is a good but moderate therapeutic improvement with a meaningful benefit.",DAI475
2,16.e,"The best would be a randomised trial in Caucasian population for 2L treatment compared to paclitaxel ramucirumab which is difficult to get now because it is now registered in Europe.

2,17.b,[with trail b do you think it could be included in esmo?] it is not the stringest evidence and [maybe?] yeah I would think so.,DAI475
2,18.a,"It depends on pretreatment and it depends on how high the HER2 positivity was. If possible and it is easy and out of some coincident I do another gastroscomy and biopsy and I see that the tumour is still highly HER2 positive then it is a strong argument for using the product [all of them?] if the tumour was only low HER2 positive in the first line setting even and the patient already ahs some pulmonary problems I would rather use paclitaxel ramucirmumab and keep product x maybe for the 3L. In percentage, it is sort of 50 - 50. In 50% I would probably try and use it to get experience with the product as well and in the other 50% I would say I stick with the well-known paclitaxel ramucirumab and have this perhaps as an option for later [3L?] yeah then I would use it in 3L. [there more?] yes. I think if the drug is so convincing that I would either if the patient is HER2positive then I would give it a try in the 2L or 3L. But every HER2 positive patient I would think to give this product at one or the other line.",DAI475
2,176,"Just a quick mention of this big issue of rebiopsying the tumour. We know that patients who are HER2 positive prior to the 1L treatment if they get progressive disease after being treated with trastuzumab we know that more or less 60% of patients have lost the HER2 positivity. SO in 2L if you dont retest for HER2 positivity the chances are only 30% that the patient is still HER2 positive. and in trial B every patient was retested prior to giving the drug product x and only HER2 positive patients prior to this treatment in the 2L they were treated but now there are data that the drug product x even has some activity in HER2 low expressers and the registration is for HER2 low also. and you don't need to retest it in gastric cancer to give it in 2L setting so there is still this uncertainty whether we reproduce the results of trial b with overall response rate of 40% if we just give it to everybody who just was HER2 positive in 1L because that is not the same population as in trial b. that is another argument, that is why we dont give it to everybody in 2L setting. It is a but complicated but time will show. [her2 low in gastric too?] There is one trial which investigated the subpopualtion and there was some activity in her2 low gastric cancer too. but the data is only very small but it points at it that there is also some activity in HER2 low gastric cancer because of the bystander effect.",DAI475

3,1.a,Already answered. Stimations are correct considering ranges. (from WS),DAI475
3,2.a,"[3 for 2L 4 and 3L+],3,3,4",DAI475
3,2.b,"absolutely speculative (from WS) ---- I have played the game you proposed but I don't really know exactly with what you meant with clinical burden because it is not already standarised in GC. GC is a devastating disease, people become very symptomatic, their nutrition is a clinical common problem. Metastatic disease may be from the lymph nodes, may be from the peritoneal spread, may be from liver metastases and the impact on the symptoms of the patient is very variable. But we assume that based on the 1L would be from a 2-3 impact of burden of disease, in 2L there would be progression  from 1L so that there would be more disease at that diagnosis [Note: last part of sentence not quite clear from recording, around 4:00]. And maybe in 3L they would be in 3-4 or maybe because theya are even progression more. And maybe considering that 5 would be almost in the moment of death that was my logic for answering that question.",DAI475
3,2.c,"These patients have too many problems. Apart from metastatic locations, this was maybe when the primary tumour was not operated that is then chronic disease. The primary tumour might be symptomatic and that is a big problem because maybe the patient does not have a vey high burden of metastatic disease but the primary tumour is causing problems and that may interrupt your treatment, make a patient condition very difficult to follow in the course of the treatment for advanced disease. And the other problem would be the peritoneal spread. I mean in GC with peritoneal spread is a very ...(cannot make out, 05:13) scenario. It may coincide with metastatic disease in the liver or lymphnodes, or even be isolated. But when peritoneal spread is causing symptoms, maybe obstructions, maybe pain, maybe subobstructions(?) that complicated all because it causes the patient to be admitted to the hospital, their nutrition, poor condition. So when you are considering in a palliative setting, prolonging life with quality of life it is very difficult to find quality of life with a very symptomatic peritoneal spread.",DAI475
3,3,"Well I mean maybe you tend to see that the economic burden is most related to the antineoplastic treatment but I think GC is is becoming more like colon cancer at least that is the tendency where I am. So you have more many procedures participating and all the departments we are performing surgeries of the primary tumour sometimes even in advanced disease we are performing surgery not even in metastiatic disease. We are asking the digestive system specialist to do some stenting, we are making some other procedures. Patients are even admitted in the intensive care unit, we are making a very important nutritional support and supplements and nutrition are also expensive, the demanding in consultants are increasing and I would say it is obvious the antineoplastic treatment is a main part of the economic cost but it is not absolutely the only part of the economic cost.",DAI475
3,3.a,"I would say roughly I am making calculation, and I think we should do it even in a public health system as the one I mainly work in, you should make your calculations on the quality of life year gained cost. So that becomes more difficult to be justified when you are reaching 2L and 3L because QoL is more important and the difficult for the treatment to gain that QoL year gainedis more important. So you are looking maybe deeper into the cost so to justify that you are doing okay. ,3,3,2",DAI475

3,4.a,"[it might differ a bit] I mean not that much. We for very advanced GC perform HER2 testing, we perform PDL1 CPS, we perform protein expression in assay or defective protein expression (?). So when patients are HER2 we are going for combination with ChT with trastuzumab, when patient is MSI we consider immunotherapy and ChT and when patient is CPS more than 5 we go for immunotherapy with ChT and you know there are situations where we use doublet therapy. Once the patient is progression our standard 2L is paclitaxel ramucirumab and when there are contraindications for ChT we would use ramucirumab, when there are contraindications for any antiangiogenic   for ramucirumab we would consider taxanes or irinotecan. We would not use pembrolizumab in 2L, it is not already approved in Spain, we would consider in MSI I would ask for 1L to be used with combination chemotherapy and in the third line our standard treatment would be trifluridine-tipiracil even and this is extraordinary situation we would consider ay further line with irinotecan if a patient preserved the peformance status. [3L Lonsurf?] Yes [ mainly lonsurf and then sometimes taxan and irino?] Yes mainly irinotecan because taxane we use in the 2L combination with ramucirumab. Some specific very very rare times we use docetaxel after paclitaxel in 2L but it is not common.",DAI475
3,4.c,"Well I would say now there are some changes coming, I think we will identify some more specific molecular subgroups apart from the HER2 positive patients because we know that there are some molecular subgroups in GC but we have no got any targeted agents for those molecular subgroups. Just recently we have a new group the Claudin-positive group and there is a drug which has some efficacy in a Ph3 clinical trial the spotlight. In the near future we have another trial the Globe (?) that I hope will show us the efficacy of zolbetuximab (?) against claudin-positive gastric cancer. So that will be a new subgroup like the HER2-positive patients and they will receive ChT plus zolbetuximab. I think we must improve the predictive markers for the immunotherapy. we are now using CPS PDL1 but I think we should strive to finding a combination predictive biomarkers that allow us to know what patients are get the most benefit of ChT. And I think for the 2L we should consider evaluating again the biological and molecular status of the patient. There has been a fairly (cannot make out 13:10) anti-HER2 treatments in 2L for HER2-positive patients but we now know that some patients lose their HER2 positivity in 2L so we should again test because there is a clonal evolution in most GC so they may change in 30-60% of the patients that has molecular markers estalished when they are exposed to 1L treatment. So we should consider (cannot make out) what this is when we go to 2L and there we should consider maybe those molecular targets it may use them that molecular status maybe with a liquid biopsy maybe easier to do than taking a sample or biopsy from the patient and then I would consider also for 3L and other ones. And also as I said I think there are some patients now with better treatments with the introduction of immunotherapy either for HER2 positive or HER2-negative and we will having more responses and we may have some opportunity for making some surgery with some survival benefit for patients.",DAI475
3,5,"[what are key unmet needs] Well as I said I think we know that from anti-HER2 treatment combination are increasing responses in 1L but we didn't (?15:00) get that benefit in survival. In the near future it is already in the USA but not yet in Europe we may have the immunotherapy combination with a HER2-positive in 1L. i think that will change the landscape because it seems that the synergistic effect of the anti-HER2 therapy and the immunotherapy is very big and patients have a much greater survival in that scenario. And as I said we should consider evaluating again the HER2 status when patients have progressed into 1L before considering any treatment in 2L and so there might be an option for anti-HER2 therapy , it may be combined with ChT or only one compound, there are some vaccines coming maybe in combination with immunotherapy so I think that is an open space we must be broad minded and this HER2 population should be tested in order to evaluate what mechanisms of resistance they have, if they do not reserve the HER2 positivity status and what other targets we should target some therapies.",DAI475
3,5.a,"5,5,5",DAI475
3,6,"I have got mainly two of them. Those are the tucatinib and trustuzumab deruxtecan. For tucatinib we know that there are some results from colon cancer, I read today I think that there is a recent FDA approval of the combination of tucatinib and trustuzumab for colon cancer HER2 positive so that implies that it is being developed for a long time in colon cancer and might have a role also in GC and obviously the one we have more information on recently is trastuzumab deruxtecan. We have already an EMA approval with Ph2 clinical trial also with no comparator arm and even when there is a Ph3 tial ongoing in 2L which is being compared to the supposed standard paclitaxel ramucirumab so I think that is a change in the attitude of the EMA becuase with a Ph2 only one arm it was decided for an approval in that indication. [sort of seen that, your perceptons around EMA trial] I think there are coming more and more scenarios where maybe with Ph2 clinical trial results you will have to decide wether to approve or not. But what surprises me is that the drug is already doing a Ph3 clinical trial for that indication so it seems surprising that when the laboratory itself has onsidered that they should do this Ph3 clinical trial in order to confirm these results and to show  their superiority against the standard arm the regulatory agency has considered that they alreayd have enough results to be approved. So it sounds bizarre.",DAI475
3,7,"Well I think they may go for a fourth treatment combo because we are now seeing that trastuzumab is having some synergistic effect with immunotherapy, we know also some antiangiogenic agents have some synergistic effect with immunotherapy, we know antiangiogenic treatments work well with ChT with paclitaxel ramucirumab for example, we know that ChT works well with trastuzumab and also with immunotherapy so why not may w consider in the future using  immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy combined with anti-HER2 and even combined with antiangiogenic. I think we will shift from double to triplet and even start to test a four combination. mostly considered that combinations may be tolerable even in a 2L treatment for advanced GC. [for IO combination would that still be if therapy in 1L include it as a combo in 2L?] We know normally that for ChT although there are some exceptions, we change the ChT combo when we go from 1L to 2L. But first we know that maintaining some antiangiogenic agents from 1L to 2L may be of benefit. and there is something we havn't tested and that is the maintanece of immunotherapy in 2L once the patient has progressed through immunotherapy in 1L. But we know that immunotherapy has a benefit beyon progression in 1L because patients still get benefits from the 1L treatment in the 2L even without immunotherapy in the second line. Now that immunotherapy has come to 1L I think there will be some trials testing the impact of sustaining immunotherapy in 2L. I think that will be a new question to answer.",DAI475
3,8,In 3L as I said we should again test for HER2 and if the patient is sustaining HER2 positivity then we may consider sustaining some anti-HER2 therapy. And depending on the 2L treatments treatments that are now considered 2L now may move to 3L and the one in the 3L may shift and go to 4L. That may be the logical movement.,DAI475
3,10,"Well in the trial A which would be a trial to compared to 2 arms  I see no reason why the comparator should be irinotecan or paclitaxel once we are considering that the treatment is in 3L we know that these treatments are not the standard in 3L. And for that patients we should consider what they are receiving in 2L, typical 2L should be paclitaxel ramucirumab and you are considering as another choice for physicians paclitaxel. I have also not read that there is testing for HER2 positivity for study entry. I think that is also very important. The trail A is in Asian population so this is the trial with 2 arms that would not be applicable to some Western populatons because now we know the Asian population and the EMA is not considerig only Asian results regarding advanced GC so that is something we should take into account. I find its its normal to consider a response rate when coming from a PH2 clinical trial in bith cases trial A and trial B, I don;t know what is the grounding for considering 15% for the physicians choice irinotecan or paclitaxel in 3L is unexpected result. I cannot see the reference and the same goes for the mOS and PFS for the comparator arms of the physician's choice and hence I would say it would be spectacular to have a drug in 3L having 50% ORR as is expected in trial A and even 12.5 mo OS which until 3mo ago was the mOS for patients from 1L so that is spectacular. and PFS of 5.5mo so you are even having 7 months of survival after progressing to 3L so that sounds something also strange to me. And the problem with trial B is it is a proof of concept and in 2L I don't know how you can match that you are expecting in 3L 50% overall responses and in 2L 40% of responses and no difference in OS and PFS even though you are considering different populations, Eastern and Western population but you are considering 3L vs 2L , trial a and trial b so it sounds not very common to have so similar expected results in different lines in both trials  [irino numbers higher ?] I do not expect, I have not experience I have no data to consider that, to me a patient in 3L having 8.5 mo of survival is not common. I mean patients in a recent trial the one of Claudin I was talking about before the control arm was ...( cannot make out 30:25) ChT with placebo in 1L the OS is 15 mo. So considering that patients from 3L are living 8.5 mo is that in there is in 1 and 2L it is 7 mo and in 3L they live 8mo that seems to be not logical. And also that patients are progressing in 3.5 mo after receiving 3L, once 3L has got a failure they survive 5 mo more, something strange. because they are supposed to not receive any further line, that would be 4L, there is not approved 4L and maybe there are no drugs to be given anymore and maybe the patient is surviving 5 mo with only palliative treatment without antineoplastic teatment only BSC that is a long time to me for a GC.",DAI475
3,11.c,I would necessary ask for some Western population data. I mean even a trial with a certain amount of patients from a Western population 20/30% of patients or even a trial that is specific for Western population because we absolutely know that gastric cancer is differentt in Asian population to Western population.,DAI475
3,12.b,"[SAT, how do you view the value of the product?] Well it would be a good value we have already reviewed trastuzumab deruxdecan has obtained an approval from EMA for 2L just having data from a ph2 clinical trialwith only one arm considered with response rate and some data in survival. So that would maybe be a similar case. If you are again making the testing for HER2 you have the strong point that you are performing molecular selection of the patients. The already approved 2L treatment has no approval depending on the molecular testing  but if you perform HER2 testing you have this molecular selection, this precision-medicine that likes to the regulatory agencies. So that is a strong point and considering it is a small population of patients they may consider that point. And with these results you can make an indirect comparison to the alternative regimens you may use, paclitaxel ramucirumab, and you could check maybe what would be the results for them with the standard treatment. [if indirect comparison on OS, PFS compared to multiple different 2L options - valuable data?] I think maybe that should not come from the laboratory, the pharmaceutical company, but in my experience when collaborating with regulatory agencies, when they are facing approvals based on Ph2 clinical trial with only one arm clinical trials in small populations where it is not easy to perform a ph3 clinical trial they have tried to find what the results for this specific population are with available treatments so far and they tend to make that intercomparison and scientifically that is not fair but regulatory agency makes that sometimes to check if that new option makes value apart from the ones that were available until then.[ are you saying sometimes agency conducts ITC?] yes that is it with no maybe formal analysis but just hown the responses were. So I would say for trial a what is the standard now, paclitaxel ramucirumab. Okay le's look for some publication testing what the results of paclitaxel ramucirumab in HER2 population were in 2L.Okay what were the responses, what were the responses, what was the mOS, what was the mPFS and how this compares with the ones we are having with the new product. Oh these seem to be very similar so it is not adding any benefit or it changes a lot so when considering that I may consider this a valuable drug or a valuable alternative.",DAI475
3,13,"To me the first trial is considering 85% Grade 3 AEs so it seems to me high considering a 3L treatment. Also pneumonitis is a hard or severe adverse effect so 10% in 3L that is something you should consider as important also from a regulatory standpoint. in 3L and if you compare that to the comparator arm you are only having 55% AEs and the discontinuation is much less in the comparator arm. So I would say that toxicity is a concern in that trial A. That is not not that much in trial b because G3 AEs are much less, are 55% although pneumonitis is sustained and if I were the laboratory the pharmaceutical industry I would work to find some clues that annouce as the pneumonitis slide (uncear from recording 38:35). Let's check with an X-Ray after cycle 2 for the patient if it is making some infiltrates or something like that just announced (?) so that we as clinicians can procludethe event of the pneumonitis",DAI475
3,13.a,"[side effects influencing prescribing or ability to receive therapies?] Well when you are coming to 2 and mostly 3L you are as I said before more evaluating QoL and risks and benefits. Patients tend to be more fragile. They normally are more reluctant to treatment because 2 treatments before have failed so they do not trust that much in treatment any longer. So I think it is maybe more important to consider the AEs and to share these with the patient. Pneumonitis is not a very common AE from the treatments so far in the GI tumours, they have some with oxaliplatin but whenever you have it patients are symptomatic and you cannot reverse it. So I think that is something I said that is something to concern.",DAI475
3,15,"[with additional trial?] Well I find it is a well designed clincial trial but obviously you should test for HER2 positivity before study entry but what surprises me is considering and knowing trial a and trial b is that now in a phase 3 clinical trial I don't know where are the population from but that is international but you are sustaining your  response rate, it was 40 and 50 and you have 45 here so you are considering that there will be no decrease in response rate. You are even increasing your PFSb and also increasing your mOS. [compared to te ph2 study?] that is it. Normally we tend to be frustrated in ph3 clinical trials because we design them with the ph2 clinical trial results and then they do not reply the ones we have in the ph2 clinical trial results.",DAI475
3,16.a.i,[do you think about it 2L+?] I try not to make plans with the patients. I try to offer them the best treatment at any line I consider so because you don't know if the patient is going to reach later lines. So when I face a patient for 2L I consider what is their best option that they have for that moment and I use it.,DAI475
3,16.b.i,"I would consider that 3-4, so I would go up.",DAI475
3,16.c.i,"[only 3L] If they get the endpoints they want? [yes lets assume the data is shown achieved] I would say 2.5 maybe a 3 for the thirdline, yes 2-3.",DAI475
3,16.d,"[for 3L rationale] because it is important, even if it isn't such a big improvement it is an important improvement compared to the one we are having so far. That is whyI consider 2-3. [for 2L?] Well because we are still maintaining the molecular selection of the patients. And to me in the 2L having a PFS that important and maintaining that survival is important, comapared to the one we have right now also.",DAI475
3,16.e,[any additional evidence or data like to see?] obviously level 1 evidence is a randomised Ph3 clincial trial but in case you do not consider a Ph3 clinical trial I would say why not perform in Western population a Ph2 comparator trial against out standard arm according to the esmo guidelines. That would be the least I would ask for a treatment to be considered by the regulatory agencies or at least what I would consider the data that must present to a pharmacy in the hospital to ask for an extraordinary use for the drug to show that you get some benefit compared to the alternative treatment that they have so far.,DAI475
3,17.b,"[do you have national guidelines or reference ESMO?] No I mean I am part of the executive team of the Spanish national society of oncology. We update normally every 2-4 years our national guidelines, we publisht hem in clincial translational oncology. I worked on them. And they tend to be similar to the esmo guidelines but they are also determined by the regulatory approvals we have in Spain. So they tend to be more real for us.[if included in esmo would tehy be included in ES?] We may consider to include it in the text but maybe not in the algorithm because we must be very cautious when making statements in our guidelines and we tend to refer ...(unclear, 49:06) if any product is recommended by the ESMO guidelines, or is approved by the EMA or is reimbursed or not in Spain. So when it is reimbursed in Spain and approved already in Spain we may consider to put it into the algorithm, when it is not we may make a ntoe in the text but not include it in the algorithm. [reimbursement influences where it is uncluded in the guidelines?] Yes obviously and you know maybe reimbursement is not  yet decided but there are some situations where reimbursement is denied from the regulatoory agencies. When there is such a decision of denied reimbursement there is no option for the doctor to ask for the extraordinary use of that drug. when there is no opinion about reimbursment you may ask for an extraordinary use and you may have an answer about the particular clinical case. So that is a very specific situation. [so if no decision then can ask for extraordinary use but if decided then no?] We have a process. When  the drug is approved by the EMA from that moment until the regulatory agencies in Spain make a statement, it may be even a year or more that there is no opinion from the regulatory agency in Spain but there is already an EMA approval, during that period you may try to ask for the use of that drug as an extraordinary use. And then it comes the moment when the regulatory agency in Spain makes a decision. when the decision is that they agree that they will reimburse there is no problem but sometimes they deny reimbursment. Once they deny reimbursmement there is no option asking any order of treatment  because it is denied, they would not (??) that request.",DAI475
3,18,[assume ESO recommended how would you use it compared to other treatments?] As I said I would retest for HER2 positivity before considering an HER2 directed therapy. That is why also I was confident I should have a t least a ph2 comparator treatment compared the new drug and the standard treatment. If that is not the case the problem is that some of the products for instance ramucirumab has got an approval only in 2L.So if I don't use it in 2L I am not allowed to use it in 3L. If product X gets an approval for 2 or later lines I am allowed to use it in 3L. So just for practical reasons I may maintain my attitude in 2L as now it is and I would postpone the new drug to 3L because I am allowed to use it. [because efficacy isn't string enough to replace ram pac or no comparison?] Well it seems to be that with those ph2 clinical trial results may beat paclitaxel ramucirumab but we must remember we are comparing ph2 one arm clinical trial results to ph3 two arm clinical trial results. We as oncologists know that clinical trial results tend to worsen when you go from ph2 to ph 3 clincial trials and we also know that beenfit of paclitaxel ram is independent of the status of HER2 so I wouldn't be so robust when making an statement in that particular.  ----,DAI475
3,18.a,[said you might wait for 3L ] depends on the label of course [ out of 100 how many would you wait with?] It is also important because we are considering sustaining strategy. and that strategy is antiher2 therapy so it would be very important how much benefit did the patient get from the 1L anti her2 therapy. that shows you the dependency of the disease to antiher2 therapy. If the patient progresses in 4 months through ChT and antiher2 therapy I wouldn't expect a great benefit if a 2L antiher2 therapy. but if the patient progresses let's say after ChT and maintanence treatment for anti-her2 therapy for 9 mo I may consider that that test in 2L is her2 positiv that antiher2 therapy may be of benefit.,DAI475
3,176,"It is also very important to me that when you consider to perform any design of a new drug and you are thinking about what treatment you want to beat, what control arm you want to beat that you look for the most recent results of that comparator. Because you are now for instance considering paclitaxel ramucirumab in this ph2 clinical trial and maybe you are considering the results of a ph3 clinical trial of paclitaxel ramucirumab but now that are 5years old. Some patients tend to live longer tehy tend to get more benefit as time passes on with the same drugs and maybe your statistical assumptions are wrong because you make them with the ph3 clinical trial results 5 years old  so it is important to raise the bar of the control arm so that your assumptions are not wrong done.",DAI475
4,1,"[aGC patients that are HER2+] I think these are correct in the number in our country. We have ~15-20% HER2+ gastric patients. The split in 1st and 2L is quite appropriate. The mOS for HER2+ is lower than in our country â€“ not 21 months but can be 24-25 months. For HER2- the mOS of 33 months is a bit optimistic. For the 20-25 patients, being HER2 negative. The difference in mOS between HER2 neg and pos is not that different, not 1 year difference between those 2. For slide 5, the number of patients in the entire nation being 2 or 3L GC, the estimation is quite good, we have almost 1000 patients treated for 2L or 3L GC.

We can use immunotherapy in 1L in combo or alone in MSI high dMMR patients ESMO guidelines say pembro or nivo  in 2L we may use it 1L if the patient MSI high. For the rest we agree, we donâ€™t have much use in ramucirumab without chemotherapy. We use 90% of the time ramu in combo with chemotherapy (weekly paclitaxel).

[so has to be reimbursed for AIOM?] absolutely, cannot recommend a drug not reimbursed [if included then 3L or later because not reimbursed in 2L?] I think so. [If included in AIOM in 3L or later, how would you expect to prescribe and use?] All the patients that have PS01, could not prescribe to patients with PS 2 in 3L? Could be 50-60% of those that go to 3L [youâ€™re saying PS2 or BS2, is that fitness biomarker?] It is fitness of the patient",DAI475
5,86,"Aligned with understanding [accuracy of estimate?] itâ€™s a rare population so if we estimate maybe 20 thousand cases of aGC in FR a year, well 200 is reasonable and clearly the majority of patients actually access [so most patients progress to 2nd line of treatment?] well most patients progress after 1L but are still not eligible for 2nd line. Minority of patients die during first line â€“ itâ€™s really infrequent.",DAI475

TDXD not reimbursed by social secuirty in FR but if I give it to my patient the hospital pharmacy has to pay, actually they donâ€™t pay for it now, but the cost is high [sounds like no reimbursement is a major challenge] exactly. Lack of reimbursement because The pharma company did not submit reimbursement xxx in 1L treatment. They do not want to give any extended access in this setting and this is really a shame. I donâ€™t remember the name of the study but first line trial and they do not want cross over and no expanded access for this drug which is a shame when we look at phase 2 study. Itâ€™s a shame.",DAI475

We do not have access to ramu or nintedanib so we do docetaxil for majority of patients in 2L setting. In 1L  agree with this standard of care but we do not have access to PDL1.  [You have access to pembro mono in 2nd line?] 1L for wt or 2L for mutant patients but not really relevant to give PDL1 inhibitor to patients with xx [really hard to understand] [Any local guidelines you refer?] no, we follow the wt pathway and I still give these patients some IO + chemo for majority paitnets in in first line and 2nd line is doxitaxel or doxa + trastuzumab. which trastu is not associated with high cost, we may add trastu to doxitaxel but this is out of the approval and reimbrusement  [The reason for 2L doxa + trastu is that because lack of reimbursement of some options?] of course, my preference would be TDXD because in the DL-01 trial there was was 60% ORR which is very high.",DAI475
5,89.d,"We need randomized studies as with those we are able to go for an approval and that is the main point. Itâ€™s easy to do a study versus docitaxel, its 10% response rate. First the strategy is to go for 1L which is okay but then I'm not sure a 1L trial vs Pembro and chemo owuld be positive versus in 2L where you ORR 60%, docitacel 10% . So, TDXD vs docitaxel have  kind of 100 patinet randomized phase II study and you show the benefit and you're done.

Strategy with ADC â€“  we have prelimianry data and response rate high. Mobo was about 24-30%? in 1L rate so  a bit lower but probably less  toxicity even if we have some toxicity. With this treatment precluding treatment duration of treatment, this is at least what we have inexon 20 mutation EGFR mutation cohorts. There is a need for more data in those patients. There is a need for phase III.",DAI475

Very important as comparators are different. In the first line the response rate we have chemo + IO, in HER2 mutant maybe 30-35% response rate which is quite high in 2L we have doxitacel with response rate of 10%. important to differentiate between first and second line also in the SoC control arm",DAI475

[safety influencing prescribing decisions] In this setting, metastatic her2 mutant we have no options. Even if toxicity is very high I will prescribe it because I have no other option. These patients are young. There is no major risk to prescribing the drug. If we can expect high efficacy we can accept significant level of adverse events. ADCs are available largely for BC, I believe we can learn from the BC oncologists [any particularly concerning AEs? Making you hesitant?] I was expecting these kind of figures for safety and efficacy. I'm convinced by this data. I previously prescribed Tdxd to some patients off-label and it worked very well. [any that may stop continuation?] need to pay attention to pneumonitis but patients with lung cancer have regular CT scans so I believe this is less of an issue than other locations. This is something to be aware of but  I would not hilghlight this as it is part of the MoA amaybe something  to consider is when witching to Enhertu in patients previously receiving immune check point inhibitors need to respect a wash out period of at least 4 weeks to avoid a combination of the risk of ILD.  tThis is well known as we switch a lot from IO to targeted agents in lung cancer and this is something thoracic oncologists are aware of",DAI475

Even if not phase 3 in 2L, there is ongoing phase 3 which should lead to some kind of approval for the compount. The FR authorities like to have this perspective when approving extended access programme. It was the case for anivantemab (?) in EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Kept expanded access programme, 1L trial was ongoing and completed so expect compund to become available based on this. Same situation here,  there is some hope for FR authorities to approve Enhertu in this setting [if prod x not reimbursed, how does that influence prescribing?] would not be able to prescribe it because my pharmacist will not fulfill it [reduces it to 0?] yes",DAI475
6,86,"I thought about that too. We try to calculate. Together we have in my country around 55k new diagnoses of lung cancer. In metastatic stage this would be 70%, so we talk about maybe 30k patients. Half of them have adenocarcinoma around 15k, and then about 1-2% have a HER2 mutation. So my calculation would be a little bit larger than that you know. It would be more like the direction 500-700 patients if you diagnose all patients and do a genetic testing on all patients. But overall it is a small group of patients and even in larger centres like ours we do not see that often patients who have that type of mutations but they are not as rare as some other mutations.

The overall outcome of these patients is poor, they have a por prognosis and the SoC up to now is not very effective.",DAI475

There are clinical studies and some drugs have been under investigation but it is not very well specified how to tret these patients specifically.",DAI475
6,88,5,DAI475
6,88.a,"what do you mean? If you can treat them properly they ususally have a shorter treatment of time how ong they get treated, they die earlier. So in terms of economic burden if you think of the cost of the therapy is one point, the other point is the economic burden due to the effect of somebody who is still working but is not contributing to the overall workforce in the country. They are two different things that you have to consider.",DAI475
6,89,1,DAI475
6,89.b,"No usually if you have adenocarcimo with PDL1 expression you do a triple therapy in these patients combining platinum-based ChT pemetexed and an IO drug. And that is the Soc for 1L. And for the patients with poor or no PDL1 expression, some people still do no IO but in most indiation they do IO too and they do a triplet. But you at least always have a doublet. [what is triplet compared to doublet] The doublet is platinum-based ChT or pemetrexed, and the triple would be the addition of an IO drug such as pembrolizumab or atezolizumab, Io drugs, immunooncology drugs. [ what does the treatment approach look like for her2 positive patients?] Well in 1L they will still receive the receive the respective combination based on the guidelines and in 2L we look for clinical trial or compassionate use programs. There are a couple of patients out and we try to get those patients into clinical studies. [what was this program?] It is something that if the drug is not marketed yet in your country there are compassionate use programs and if for example the drug is marketed in the US but not in Europe you can ask the company to provide the drug in a clinical use program. [how often used?] Still it is a very rare indication, there are a couple of companies working on that specific HER2 mutation overepression and then you can ask these people. If the clinical trial isn't working then you have a doublet, in Europe it is mainly a doublet of docetaxel plus a multikinase inhibitor like nintidanib or dicetaxil plus ramucirumab. It is not very common up to know to use a monotherapy like docetaxel in Europe anymore and particularly in DE.  [nintdanib available 2L?] yes exactly. [because sometimes ot locally reimbursed] yes exactly but here it is the case for both options. [any represented here that you wouldn't be able o use] no all are acceptable but clinical use has changed over the last couple of years. And post triplet therapyin 1L ChT plus IO then you fail then you usually do a doublet.",DAI475
6,89.c,"[aware of updtae, any thought] they don't differ very much from what we are saying, they are very much in line with the ESMO guidelines. [use docetaxel and ninetanib or ramu combo, box right down?] yes exactly in adenocarcinoma patients. [what other groups?] that is only licensed in DE for adenocarcinoma and for squamous carcinoma you only have the option of docetaxel ramu. But HER2 mutations are mostly prevalent in aenocarcinoma. [any other comments on the S3?] no that is pretty straight forward. It is just importnat for negotiations later on because this is the backbone of negotiations later on as the SoC comparator would be the doublet not the monotherapy. So clinical studies who still use docetaxel as the comparator run into problems later on if they would like to be accepted with better pricing because their comparator arm is docetaxel and not the combinaton. [because no targeted treatment follow path of less than 50% PDL1 patient pathway?] yes",DAI475
6,89.d,"Obviously depite the fact that this combination of plt-Cht pemetr and IO drugs is more effective than earlier drug combinations, the patients still progress early with HER2 mutations. So obviously we have not found the right drug compiunt yet to treat that patient cohort in a better fashion. So this is the unmet need. Overall, metastatic disease and at stage 4 still has very limited OS time period. so we have to do better for that too.",DAI475
6,90,5,DAI475
6,91,"Yes the overall situation at stage 4 is QoL. You treat patients to improve symptoms, to improve qoL score, to improve performance status. All these drugs here, especially the TKIs, definitely have a toxic side profile, they have side effects. So we have to learn about that. T-Dxt is very effective in certain forms of subsets of breast cancer but the overall data quality we have at the moment for the special cohort  in exon20-HER2-mutated LC is not very large so we have to learn about that. But this is an interesting group of agents. Obviously more specific than different options we have so far but it is toxic. [concerns with safety for QoL?] yes exactly.",DAI475
6,100,Well trial 1 is only about safety data. The other one is at least including some clinical endpoints and they describe their respective toxocity profiles so obviously we have to learn about that.,DAI475
6,101.b,"[trial 2] that is fine, it is very helpful but you need a historical cohort to know what is the outcome of that population if you negotiate the pricing. [clarifying?] I am saying you need a real-world evidence database showing the outcome of that population. If you are trying to get into the market you need to show efficacy of the drug and for that reason you should have a matrix what you are comparing against. If you don't know what i the outcome of the popualtion you are interested in you dont have a comparator and for this reason you need a historical cohort in a SAT. If this would be placebo controlled everything would be easy. [comparision against patients were treated with?] whatever is available.",DAI475
6,101.b.i,"That is exactly the sensitive issue. If you compare it to docetaxel it might be helpful to some markets but in European markets it might not be that helpful because you have to show superiority. And if you show superiority and not non-inferiority then it is a question about pricing. Whatever you want to do there is all rare mutations over the last couple years the GBA asks you to show data on patients who have that mutaton and what is their outcome. So whatever you do you have to come up with some kind of concept to show that your new drug treatment option is an effective and well tolerated with less side effects associated new option in that field. [in terms of you understanding the clinical value, instead of what using now? doublet or with IO?] that is 1L. so what is your question? [so would replace docetaxel and combo?] yes [with combo?] yes exactly and other wise the pricing would be against docetaxel",DAI475
6,101.d,"They are fine. The therapeutic RR is great, the duration of response if good, the PFS is great, and the mOS too. This are good data.",DAI475
6,101.f,"Safety is an issue. G3+ is GI toxicity or what is it? [Grade 3 adverse events] 50% is a fair number so what kind of drug-related adverse events are these? It is not pneumonistis, is it GI or what is it? [ 5% aneamia and naseau, pneumonitis 2.5%, common listed] Okay but still half of the patients have a problem. [would this impact prescribing?] you have to be more cautious and you have to think which type of patient would tolerate this type of side effect profile [more fit?] exactly. espcially it is an elderly population lung cancer patients, they tend to be frail so that might be a problem.",DAI475
6,102,"GI we can manage very nicely, pneumonitis is a problem, any major organ damage, like hepatitis, myocarditis, severe skin disorders you know are not very nice, they are worrysome for the patient so that might be a problem.",DAI475
6,104,"[dosing different for trial 1 so still considered?] This is absolutely essential. The more data you can present the better it is. Even with a different dosing you learn a lot about the toxicity profile, learn a lot about the clinical cohort you were interested in. That is fine.",DAI475
6,105,"no this looks good so far, it is a ph2 clinical study single arm, everything is fine. Maybe later on you need a ph3 trial depending on the size of the population you are interested in it is difficult enough. [Qol, pro?} you will definitely need that, they will definitely ask you for that. [any specifc expectations for qol?] no that is all standartised by now [so no issue is standardised metric?] exactly yes.",DAI475
6,106,"I would rate 4.,The statistical data is fine. The OS is fine, the ORR of 60% is great, the duraion of response is fine, the PFS is fine. You know this is good. This is significant therapeutic improvement. [what to get 5?] We don't have 5 in Europe. This is something you have in other countries. And it is a single-arm study. If you are placebo-controlled or have a nice comparator then we can talk breakthrough designation because you compare directly. This is the limitation of your clinical study.",DAI475
6,107,"[if EMA approved, would it be included in s3?] of course [why?] Because usually we follow the international recommendations if that is based on a clinical trial and a publication which shows clearly the benefit of the drug.  [oncopedia vs s3 vs esmo?] this is a good question. You have NCCN recommendations and we have oncopedia. Both NCCN and oncopedia are expert-based recommendations, they are not considered to be guidelines. In terms of talking about law and reimbursement and potential problems you can run intpo for reimbursement you can work with guidelines. Recommendations are weaker because they are not based on a systemic literature review and they are expert based. Oncopedia is usually faster than the ESMO or S3 guidelines but we have changed that approach with the S3 guidelines, it is a living guidelines, it is constantly adapted so the quality is higher. It is the same as the ESMO guideliens or the ESCO guidelines compared to NCCN. NCCN usually is faster but it is a recommendation. And oncopedia here is the same, it is faster but it is only a recommendation, not considered as the quality as s3 guidelines has.",DAI475
6,108,"Well once it has been approved and it is reimbursed we can use it. That would be as with other therapeutic options we do have in 2L we have to keep track of these patient cohorts to identify the right patients at the right time. That means the patient has to be a patient who has progression of disease and you have to identify the right time to get them on the treatment option. [cohorts her2?] No we tag these patients ususally, in a larger cancer centre you tag these patients normally because all these patients undergo next generation sequencing before 1L treatment so these patients are tagged with respect to their specific driver mutations. As we do not treat these patients with specific HER2 drug combinations in 1L you have to identify these patients, and if they are in the electronic dataset we can find them and identify them as potential patients once they have progression. And that is the most important issue at the moment, identifying the patient and getting the patient on track at the right time.,Maybe 10-20%.,All patients who have a HER2 mutations are eligible to use this drug and will be offered this drug, except for the patients that have a certain toxicity profile which is not tolerable in terms of the side effect this drug combiantion will ultimately have as a problem. For instance with patients already have severe ILD you cannot use this drug, there's patients who already have anemia, you think about twice to give that. But it will be the first option to offer. [more challenging safety profile than docetaxel combo?] yes [patietns less fit then still docetaxel, but if fit enought hen offer product x?] yes it would be the first option because it is specific, a precise option, it is precision oncology, we would love to give that but there are exceptions to the rule. And we when we cannot offer this these patients would go into the classic cohort of the SoC.",DAI475
6,109,"[additional trial in 1L with comparator investogators choice of â€¦platin, pemetrxed or pembro, what are your intiial throghts?] That is a smart idea, you should do that. And that will ultimately lead everybody into the testing of her2 mutations or overexpression before you start 1L and then it would be included in the panel and that would definitely be helpful. [if data strong etc shoft use to 1L] yes [thoughts on omparator?] if the established recommendation at the moment is, below 50% PDL1 triple therapy then that is the SoC I guess and you have to compare against the SoC. If you only use plt-based ChT with pemetrexed that might be problematic because that is not the SoC anymore. [comparator should be triple?] Yes I think so, that is how it is at the moment. This is how people treat the patients.",DAI475
6,176,"This is a very important issue. As we have learnt this is a very interesting and heterogenous landscape in Europe and the US. But ther are three things to consider. You should test for HER2 mutations upfront, before 1L. You should think about the 1L ph3 clinical trial. I think that is definitely going to help promote and push that market. And if you go into that market, the interesting part is if you look at that slide you showed me and you have T-Dxd, mobocertinib, which we don't really expect to be on the market, we have pyrotinib and other drugs. so there are obviously a couple of competitors on the field but overall we have a lack of data about the outcome of that population. And you should push that. Whatever you can get you hands on try to get more data about the natural course under the current treatment opiton for that population. Because later on when you argue with any type of approval authority you need these data. So having trial 1 and trial 2 despite having different dosing it is very important. but you need to enlarge your database. And the last recommendation I should have: We don't really know how her2 mutations are distributed worldwide, is there an ethnic background, is there a genetic combination between East Asia, or Europe or the US. These are things that are very important if you try to seek approval for that drug. And I am a big believer in antibody-drug conjugates. we do a lot of clincial trials on that. But the more data you have the better you are off. [ no directed therapy so less testing but need to have data how they repsond right now] yes the reason is because they are gonna ask you for that. If you raise the hypothesis we have a wonderful new drug very effective, this is a breakthrough. they will ask well how do you know. that is gonna be their answer. and then you have to come up with data. Look at these patient cohorts they fail at everything. So you need these data. And the real problem is testing testing testing if that is the issue. ----- [retesting after 1L or not standard?] That is a good question. First of all you should do testing on all patients who receive systemic therapy. This should be the first goal in all patients. And retesting if they fail we do not do in all patients. And we do retestign in all patients. And we do retesting in all patients who have for instance EGFR mutations because that really makes a difference and you have other drugs. But we don't have that so far in HER2 or in other indications. So I would assume that the better you are off the earlier you test.",DAI475
7,86,yes it does (from WS) ---- yes I think it is completely agree with my perception about the prevalence of HER2 positive in 2L. [tested for?] now only in clinical trial not in normal systems health care. [to change?] Yes maybe when we have approved drugs in this setting yes but now it is not crucial to determine this potential. [underestimated?] maybe it is underestimated yes because this number this prevalence is based on clicnial trial but when you test more people you find more % of positivity.,DAI475
7,87,2,DAI475
7,87.a,[rated low why?] yes my perception is low clinical burden because there are very few patients with this mutation. Also maybe related to they are included in clicnical trials and maybe I have a bias but in good condition. So this is my point of view of the clinical burden. [at population level small number?] yes,DAI475

7,89.b,"[current treatment approach] in general the guidelines are very open with many different treatments alternatives to treatments. I my opinion I am okat with this (cannot make out 7:00) we use this these clincial guidleines in the clinical practice. [1L for her2+?] In general the first devision is according to the PDL1 level. PDL1 is highe more than 50% we use montherpay in general because there are cases with high burden of disease we use in general in 90% pembrolizumab in 1L in monotherapy. In cases with high disease we use pembro + ChT. In cases with PDL1 less than 50% we usually treat these patients with nialate(??cannot make out) scheme using ChT plus ipilimumab plus nivolumab. In some cases only ChT. No we dont use avastin and in a percentage EFR mutated patients we use in the 1L TKI inhibitor, the same in ALK inibotor or ROS1 inhibitors. we dont have appoved the BRAF in this case we use ChT. This is the 1L in general this is our approach. [HER2 2L treatment?] In cases of HER2 positive you would use regardless of HER2 positive or not because we don't have any  special treatment we use in 2l if the patient previously was treated with immunotherapy we use ChT, in cases where we didn't previously use immunotherapy we use immunotherapy. In patients with different types of mutations we use a second generation of mutated inhibitors. In case of HER2 we use immunotherapy or ChT plus immunotherapy. [are there specific products for immuno for 2L?] for 2L nivolumab [what if used in 1L?] in 1L we use pembro if the PDL1 expression is more than 50% and if it is less than 50% nivo plus ipi. [could her2 patients be pdl1 greater or less 50?] no no we use the same approach regardless her2 disease. You would use the slide is very clear in wild type maybe her2 positive in this case not wild type we use the teatment according to PDL1 expression. More than 50% pembro, less than 50% in the box in the bottom ipi plus nico plus ChT.  [it doesnt seem like you use ramucirumab or or nintedanib or erlotinib in 2L?] yea maybe in 2L when (cannot make out 13:00) Her2 disease we would use these inhibitors. (cannot make out) for example BRAF according to the mutation we use the inhibitors but we have to have the approval. [products on right hand side are approved?] all the products in your slide have approval the only one that doesn't have approval in Spain is BRAF. In case the BRAF we use ChT. [for patient with ChT and IO 1L what is in 2L?] we usually treat these patients usually with monotherpay with ChT but only monotherpay for some (cannot make this part of the sentence out properly), in some cases erlotinib is rare. (?) [when cyramza plus Cht or vargatef?] we use ramucirumab plus ChT in patients with adenocarcinoma with no contraindication to use antiangiogenics and more than 7cm of the diameter. [can use if previously IO plus ChT?] yes we would use this combination another in patients who previously has been treated with Chemo plus IO. In this case the chemo is improtant in htis aspect the chemo is monotherapy chemo, in the 1L we use polyChT, several drugs, in the 2L only one drug.",DAI475
7,89.d,"There are a lot of needs in these patients. In 1L we have several needs, for example, is better use immunotherapy or chemo plus immunotherapy, in 2L the sequence is better use for example ramucirumab and ChT or is better use ChT and then other treatments with IO. there are a lot of unmet needs. the most important is the identification of the right treatment for the right patient and the sequence, the sequence is quite important.",DAI475

7,100,"No I think it is a very good results considering the subset progression because it is disease progression after one previous systemic therapy. The mOS is very good and also the PFS and duration of response is very good. Not very high toxicity, only diarrhea and aneamia, is not quite important.",DAI475
7,101.b,[open label studies?] In my opinion it is contradict with the usual opinion the randomised trials because it is quite difficult to have a very good randomised clinical trial in this population with this small number of patients. In my opinion it is good the design. [SAT] it is according to the design of non randomised trial. I agree with this design.,DAI475
7,101.b.i,"In this case we docetaxel. [2L?] yes we use docetaxel in 2L. [cht monotherapy?] yeah we use docetaxel monotherpay chemo it is one of the monotherapy chemo we use in 2L, more usual docetaxel, we use other drugs for example (cannot make it out 23:20) but traditionally we use docetaxel in 2L in monotherapy [comparator should be cht mono idelly docetaxel] in case it is necessary to thave a comparator it would be docetaxel. [indirect comparators?] in my opinion it is not necessary i this population to have a comparator. [statistical analysis?] yes it is valuable in this case this approach yes [docetaxel?] in my opinion it is enoguh the evidence with open label single arm because it is quite difficult to find these patients and we find a lot of time on the recruitment of these patients in clinical trials",DAI475
7,101.d,In my opinion it is more important the PFS OS than ORR. [thinking?] My perception is very good with the secondary endpoints. I know the clinical trials this specific clincial trial using ORR because it is an open label single arm phase2 in this case it is usual to this primary endpoint but in my opinion it is more important the secondary endpoints in this clinical trial. [why OS and PFS more value?] In my opnion the PFS.,DAI475
7,101.f,"[thoughts on values shown here] additional values are toxicity the safety profile is quite good. [thoughts on safety?] maybe the only concern in safety profile is the pneumonitis because it is the only imporant toxicity, the prognosis is more difficult to understand to know what is going but the rest is managable , aneamia, nausea, diarrhea is not important. ",DAI475
7,104,"[how think about trial 1 for value of product?] I think the most important for the regulatory aspect will be the OS and PFS. [different dosing still helpful?] yes, [why?] because in my opinion they are very robust results, the OS, the PFS and duration of response and in my opinion they are valulable the results in this product [makes results more robust?] maybe in the future we can design we can design a randomised trial with docetaxel as comparator but I don't think it is necessary to perform this clinical trial based on these results",DAI475
7,105,"Yeah more details for the determination of the mutation or the, the determination of type of mutation analysis, the more details of the type of the analysis, immunohistochemistry, FISH, NGS, more details about the type of determination of HER2 disease. [subsets within her2] more about the molecular diagnostics and the type of the analysis you use this specific brand or other one you know it is important the diagnostics is QoL data ever valuable to you?] in my opinion it is enough the OS the PFS and safety profile. the QoL in these patients, maybe another situation with comparator or not but in my opinion it is enough with the safety profile data. [any other safety data you want to see?] maybe more the data about the pneumonitis and ILD because this aspect related to the interstitial lung disease could be important for the clinicians, what type of patients, treated previous with IO or no or radiotherapy(?) it is quite important the identification of these patients with lung toxicity.",DAI475
7,106,"I think maybe 3 or 4.,I think it is more than we currently have but the increase of the OS and PFS is modest it is not more than one year for example.  [what would be more than modest?] modest is between 6 and 9, more than 9 to 12 mo is significant and more than 12 mo is a breakthrough innovation. [so driven by OS and PFS?] yes speaking about the PFS data. [benefit on OS indirect comparison in your head to docetaxel?] the problem in a way of OS when you use sequencing lines we could have bias in the interpretation of the OS and in my opinion in this case it is better used PFS okay according to improved OS but the first step is PFS [absolute value used?] not so much an absolute value but it is quite indicative [not 9mo on top of SOC?] when we use the 9 mo or 12mo we assume that there is some bias in the selection the patient maybe performane status and then is this the top comparator or options including docetaxel okay we can reduce the cut off of this modest or significant but more related to the specific population for example with high comorbidities maybe we can use less cut off in this case could be important the improvement at 9 mo but this is a general approach.",DAI475
7,107,"[national guidelines you look at ?] we have local national guidelines in ES, in general it is more recent than the esmo guidelines but quite simialr in the definitions than the esmo guidelines. In some cases for example in esmo gudelines, in some cases for example in esmo guidelines the BRAF is approved or recommended with inhibitors in BRAF but in ES it is not approved BRAF imhibitors so maybe there are some variations but in general they are quite similar than the esmo guidelines [included in guidelines ofr product x?] this I would question. the only comparator in this approach is BRAF in this case in ES it is not approved, maybe HER2 disease and HER2 treatment has better results than the BRAF inhibitors and also it is a small number of patients maybe it is approved but maybe it is not. [so if approved and reimbursed in ES maybe yes maybe no?] my understanding is it will be approved will we use this drug.",DAI475
7,108,"[if it is approved and reimbursed would you physician expect to prescribe it? How many 2L?] This question is related to the previous one I answered you because it is related to diagnosis. Because it is not in the current panel of diagnostics this determination, for that I insist it is quite important the diagnosis even than the treatment but the diagnosis is important because if you don't diagnose this patient you dont use this drug and this is according the diagnosis and treatment. [so right now diagnosis not reimbursed because to identify them you need to diagnose them?] totally this is the question and then if we identfy this patient we will treat this patient but the first step we have to identify this patient.  [wuld product reimbursement help with diagnosis reimbursement?] The problem in ES that the diagnosis testign and apporval is a parallel system because the diagnosis is according to the local level at the hospital, according to the pathologics and the general manner also in my country the pharmas are supportive of the diagnosis and then could be some variability in the diagnosis in the hospitals because the approve the drug is independent of the diagnositic test. [diagnostic at local and drug at national?] it is not according to the financial level of the hospital it is more related to other decision maybe (cannot make out 38:50) for example the pathologies dont know anythign abotu the new drug and they spend more time to perform this test in the lab. maybe this could (cannot make out)",DAI475
7,109,[follow up 1L trial would it impact 2L perceptions] the history and the treatments wit the patients are according to the sequence  and when you asked me about the unmet needs in 1L and 2L I mentioned before the importance of the sequence we will use in the 1L some drug we won't use the drug in the 2L. this is the question the question is the sequencing in the approval. [data published for 1L but no chnage to ema label impact on perception of drug?] yeah we have more data we have more robust decision to use this drug for example we have the approval in 2L and we have more data in 1L with good results this data supports the use in 2L yes.,DAI475
7,176,no no I think it is a good drug and a need for our patients maybe in the future some combination in this drug could be useful [combo with other drug?] yes that [what will be future 1L SoC] The best option is to try to understand untreated patients in 1L because the patients in this case are in better confitions than in 2L. My suggestion is to investigate some combination without ChT in 1L [because of side effects?] yes,DAI475
8,86,"I don't remember the exact numbers, but generally, if you consider 3-4% NSCLC patients diagnosied with her2 mutation. The 2L is not going to be more than half those patients. It's difficult for me, I don't know how you calculate 300 patients. [your perspective is useful] HER2 mutation is probably 3-4%. 3/4 years ago we didn't have all this information. HER2 mutation and insertion are recently explored mutations and we explore them more and more now and we are investigating more so the percentag will surely increase. HER2 mutation is very heterogenous. We need to investigate this mutation more for sure. [When you say heterogenous, are you saying outcomes?] I mean is the type of mutation for sure but also patient outcomes. One of the most recent drugs investigated, enhertu for example, you have the cohort with exon 20 and the activity also with her2. Very heterogenous mutation. I don't know that the outcomes are the same. I think it differs a lot.",DAI475

I think this will change soon in next clinical trial designs. There is a plethora of heterogenised mutations. Burden of disease depends on these heterogenised mutations. A her2 exon 20 mutation does not have the same burden as other her2 mutations. Exon 20 has very high burden of disease",DAI475

Also, these patients have pleural effusion and locally in the thoracic part they are more... we have done a small analysis in our patients with HER2 and for exmple the pleural and periocardial effusions are one of the big problems and the brain mass. Also, her2 exon20 compared to other exons activated mutations it's like when you have a patient with classic EGFR mutation but has co-mutations, they are very similar and have all these burden of disease. But different to other point activated mutations where the burden is lower.",DAI475

8,89.a,"I have a suggestion - right now there are new ESMO guidelines related to targeted mutations. It was just outside one week ago. I didn't like the new guidelines, they are not at all written in the right way [what do you like and not like about the updated guidelines?] I have to comment this, here in Italy compared to FR and DE everything changed. Wildtype patients without taget therapies are divided based on PDL1, patients with high PDL1 undertake immunotherapy alone. Patients with low PDL1 undertake chemotherapy based on squamous or non-squamous and the combinations are based on checkmate 9LA, and the k-note 170 and 171, these are the only approved. Here you wrote PDL1 + bevacizumab + chemotherapy but here it's not approved [beva not approved or used in IT?] no. After that we go to the 2L and 2L for patients who receive chemo alone in 1L is simple, it's platinum based therapy so for us it's another kind of 1L. We consider it 1L chemotherapy. Patients who receive chemo immunotherapy which can be short chemotherapy combined with anti-PDL1 or long chemo with anti-PDL1 receive 3L. We are conducting a lot of trials in 3L. For us its 2L, every patient without xxx mutation has to undergo chemoterhapy or immunotherapy sequentially or in combination. After that, what do they receive in IT? Docetaxil is the standard of care in case of brain lesions, this is our actual 2L [is that for HER2 mutation as well?] the problem is there is an unmet need because we have a historical problem here, we have some of the centres that have the different destiny trials that are open. Obviously, when we have possibility to put patient in the targeted trial we will but no drug is approved for HER2 mutation in IT, even in 2L. It is obvious we know the activity of what we have reached. Compared to other treatments, we don't know the history, there is a sad story with poticinib which i dont think FDA will approve. There is sad story with moboteni I don't know the EXCLAIM results in HER2. There is a good story with trastuzumab durextecan, but there is a long need for HER2 antimutation drug. If you imagine, Destiny lung 4 will become SoC. Their immunotherapy is debatable, we don't know their efficacy because we sent to ASCO last year data and we know patients with HER2 do not respond well to immunotherapy and we need to explore more and more targeted therapy. If we had a trial now, I'm hoping a trial related to this drug. [What on the updated guidelines did you not like?] they didn't follow the same line, what I'm saying is ESMO is EU guidelines. In IT we have AIOM, the ESMO guidelines have revolutionised how they write the guidelines and they put it in this presence of oncogenic drivers mutation. KRAS, HER2, RET, MET, which actually for... they did a great mistake because the indication for entrak was not the first indication because it's already approved in IT an anti-entrak (?). For HER2,, KRAS, they didn't include... for RET for sure we need to have in 1L the target therapy. All the trials are ongoing and it's obvious they will be positive. The trials are open, we don't know, we don't have this evidence.  You cannot say that normal guidelines will say if you target therapy refer to this trial in 1L. Even FDA did not approve in 1L any drug for this mutation. If following biological idea, please, if you see trial with RET or KRAS refer it immediately to clin trial, but the guidelines today are with target. They didn't follow ame guide as for indication. HER2 is one of them. You cannot say it in 1L because we don't know especially in 1L. The foolish thing is KRAS, we approved it in 2L in Italy. Codebreak 2 didnt obtain all these fantastic results. If you have a trial everyone will feel comfortable referring to a trial even in 2L. This flowchart you need to add entrac (?) it's approved, first line in patients with entrac rearrangement.",DAI475
8,89.d,"It's a hole, we don't have nothing. There are some clinical trials and most of them failed to demonstrate a lot of activity for HER2. They was running together with eGFR exon 20 insertion. They were more positive for eGFR. For HER2, everything remain there. This is the story of mobochetinib, porotinib. for trastu dex a different story. We need more trials and more drugs but pay attention to heterogeneity of this mutation. This can lead to design failure of the trial. I know HER2 is rare but very heterogenous compared to the others",DAI475

8,100,"I have a question - the mOs is an objective here? 16 months? are we expecting the drug to give an OS of 16 months? [hypothetical outcomes, if drug were real, what would you think] ORR of 60% in 2L is very high. We are very happy with 50%. mOS of 16 months in 2L is very high, 12 months is good enough. mPFS of 7 omnths can be okay. Also, here it depends on the type of HER2 mutation. For exon 20 insertion and in 2L lower mPFS its not troubling me because 2L. mDOR is a good history. The problem with the new generation mutations is the mDOR because every time is lower. I can say I am happy but would be happier to have 10 months. [Are you saying for new gen of mutations the mDOR is lower after exposure to treatment?] yes, but after exposure to treatment not expecting it so much. The mDOR is the calculation of time of response after patient has initiated a response. What I have expected, what is the problem of the new drug in these new generation mutations? The problem of these drugs is even if you obtain a good response, you do not have a long median duration of response. In the history of eGFR exon 20, many phase 1 trials are working on these outcomes as these outcomes are important. There are people who do not respond even in 2L but if a mutation responds, why does it not stay for some time? We as clinicians are taking mDOR into account more now.",DAI475
8,101.b,"For me it can be single arm, it matters to me more the covered mutations, the more the better. I think one of the problems of previous trials is they mix all types of HER2 mutations.

That's another story",DAI475

Pneumonitis 2.5% [are there specific concerning ones?] No, the only unattractive thing is the %, 50% is high. However, I mean pnuemonitis ILD 2.5% is acceptable to compare also to enhertu or for example other anti-eGFR.",DAI475
8,105,"subgroup analysis of HER2 mutation, and if there is a possibility for multiple cohorts. Also, information on which therapy is allowed in previous lines. [QoL or PROs?] can be interesting to understand QoL but depends. I think most important is safety related data and the division between acute toxicity compared to late toxicity reporting. Another thing is the way the drug is administered [what are you thoughts?] the more simple the better but I see here infusion, obviously subcutaneous could be another route  [self administered?] not important to be self administered. Outpatient subcutaneous is better.",DAI475

The most important thing related toâ€¦ I have a question related to the breakthrough innovation is because if placing drug in 2L in patients already received HER2 drug it's breakthrough. But if placing after chemotherapy or chemo immunotherapy, still great option but we all hope this will not be the next practice. Related to slide 10 and the cohort which previously received her2 or not anti-her2 is very important",DAI475
8,107,"[would it be included in the IT guidelines if reimbursed?] depends also on the time. If the destiny lung 4 trial is positive in 1L everything will change but if this drug is allowed after anti-her line and after platinum based therapy. It is needed as another option in those previously receiving therapy. If you run this trial now and the results will be available in the next 2 years for example, it can be possible this drug will be approved also after chemotherapy. The problem is things will change as I think the DL04 trial will be positive and the anti-her2 drug can be approved in 1L and if it happens the story will chnge here [so if a diff drug comes to market and approved for 1L her2 then the potential use of this drug is this ight not be used 2L if you have 1L drug but if prod X comes to market tomorrow you would use it?] yes",DAI475

9,9,"at this stage, as usual, I think OS is indespensible to establish the real added value of the product. But of course we know that it's sometimes difficult to get the definitive data on this, so PFS can substitute for it, but they need to know they will get adequate time for the OS. [Would you expect landmark OS, in the case of immature data?] Of course. What is important is OS is there in h clinical development plan and statistically analysed. Can be secondary EP but with high level stat analysis. PFS can be primary EP. Response is a good, clasical indicator too. And QoL. We always repeat the same message, but it's important for the French.  But not in all conditions and only if interpretable, which means you have to be rigorous in the way it is measured. It has to be on a scale which is validated. It has to be included in the analytical protocols. And if you don't get that, they will not read. QoL, all PROs, etc, they are very required in oncology.

Its a pity to have phase II only but classic for early access.  Yes, the criterions are the right ones. When you come to market with an innovative drug, often you benefit from early access from he registration. Fast track, and then you only show phase II at the level of evaluation. Often nowadays that you show or the evaluation is only made on phase II. That's a pity because it's less powerful but usual, cannot reject based on this. The criterions are the rightones. QoL is lacking or not show but is very important to show I am a little surprised by the importance of the safety data, whcih is not so good. 80% grade 3 is a lot more that comparator.

But I am not enough of a specialist to answer this question. You should check. [the baseline characteristics of the patients are similar] If you look at the ENHERTU population in gastric cancer.... I don't want to mistake. I don't remember really. It tell me something with Asian populations. It will be interesting to check with other trials [What's the worst that could happen?] influence ASMR level - If there is really a diff in metabolism of the drug, which is related to the incidence of the Asian profile, they could reject by saying I'm sorry but the data doesnt correspond to the population. If there is a mix of populatin with too many asian within the profile could influence to moderate SMRrating at most, but no more. It's important to check. 2nd point about the ASMR would be the  influence on safety. The TC likes to remake the efficacy / safety profile ratio, related to grade 3 events. They could question the efficacy / safety ratio. It depends really. Do we have the number of deaths? Yes, one. If this is not the case, I guess it could be acceptable.That's a question mark to validate. SMR could be level IV, depends on importance of ... to rephrase, if we have a problem of metabolisation, which is influenced by the asian profile, I think it'll be a question of go or no go, reject or accept. If accept, that wont impact SMR. But what could influence the ASMR is the tolerancy profile by saying the efficacy / safety profile is not important but moderate.  If that is the case, it is possible to get SMR of moderate, and not important. So, question mark on safety. The ASMR would be a IV based on these EPs, 4 months of OS.",DAI475

[What could be the problem with single arm?] If only a single arm trial, it can be an important problem. Unless  you can justify single arm because no treatments available but it not (as the case here) then it cannot be the unicorn.  So trial A would have to be in the evidence. Then trial B, what is it interest. I didn't capture that at first sight, but thinking of it, we can use it again to justify that the asian population inclusion is not a problem within the clinical setting.  You cannot say there is no currently used treatment in this thereapetutic strategy, so single arm is poor in the demonstration, cannot lead to ASMR [ASMR V basically?] Yeah. In the TC is currently working on this topic because we know that the coming therapeutic innovation will come with more and more often, poor data due to the very fact that they are very innovative, so you can justify it. Even with that the TC has a big problem to resolve. How to measure the ASMR, that's not so easy. [What if Trial A is pivotal trial and Trial B is supportive, so more weight to A?] I would prefer it. The clinical trials which is the most important, which you want to elaborate and demonstrate your therapeutic added value. And the supportive one is used to reinforce one point.

[Do you think that would influence the TC?] I don't know exactly what that means when you are pivotal or supportive. Does that mean you have less robustness?That's a key question you know. If you can explain that historically you first went with pivotal trial B and then estimated that you could do a comparative trial and that you are bringing a supportive trial as a supportive range, then tell this kind of story.

I think it would make sense [why would it make sense?] [He thought the other way round so Anais clarified] I would reverse it. [Do you think that would influence the TC?] I don't know exactly what that means when you are pivotal or supportive. Does that mean you have less robustness?That's a key question you know.

Maybe, you can explain. I don't think it means anything about the robustness.",DAI475
9,20," [What do you think would be the ASMR level based on this?] If you bring both, they would not consider the trial B in the ASMR.

Now if the question is only having Trial B, what would be the ASMR level? I would say maybe you would get an inssuffiecient ASMR because they would blame the fact that you did not bring comparative data. [And if it is justified with trial B then maybe moderate?] Again, I think they would give insuffiencent SMR and not moderate, saying that you should have shown comparative data. Without that they are not able to accept this new drug in the therapeutic strategy because  it's place  is not really confirmed. They could say SMR moderate with ASMR V because without comparision it is impossible to generate ASMR. So those are the two options.",DAI475

That is why the level of adverse event is less important in trial B. Maybe they could exclude 2L. Which indiciation are we asking for? 2L+ [Yes] For sure, they could only validate in the SMR level for reimbursement for 3L+, saying that for 2L+, we don't know where we are based on the data. [Could it be the case that they are in liste in sus based on trial a and not trial b?] It could be the case. If they do not want to do so, thinking that they need a product in 2L and so on, at the best option we can get SMR moderate in the 2L with ASMR V. We can get ASMR IV with 3L and V with 2L.

9,69,"If we are in ASMR IV, we will negotiate the price based on the comparator price. So, the key question is what is the comparator that will be considered in the pricing negotiations. We would have in this design an ASMR IV in either therapeutic strategies. You do not have one single designed comparator, so you cannot say this product or this product. It will depend the physician's choice. The question behind that, what is the drugs coming into the therapeutic strategy. What is usually done is to calculate a mean price according this therapeutic strategy and according to the different market shares of the different products. So you would have maybe the PDL1, that would help for including the price. But of course, all the chemotherapy will decrease it. So you have to calculate that. And if the comparison price is too low and does not allow for coming in the market, then you have to convice the economic committee to go to another kind of comparator, which is called economic comparator, and then it's another choice, with something with a rationale of course. [We assume a 40% discount from the list to the net? Is this aligned with your understanding?] That seems to be right. If you refer to the reports of the economic committee, it's in the range.

In the previous line you can consider Pembrolizumab or Ramucirumab, but that doesn't mean it will be the unique one to consider.

We will show you the final results when we get them, maybe to help for having the remimbursement for 2L. Then comes this  RSA, not exactly RSA  but accomodational SMR on the 2L. With the accomodation, you should provide this clinical trial at a certain time. This would have to reinforce the 2L reimbursement status.",DAI475
9,81,"[Does that mean they would have price renogetiation?] Yes, they would have a new rendevouse with the TC to show the data and confirm. And with the economic committee, they would discuss the the accomodation of rebates due to including 2L from the first step. If the HAS is confirming the results for 2L, I don't know the reason why the economic committee would go back to that. [What does that mean?] If you include the ph II in the pricing negotiation, so the rebates will be based on the whole population. Then if you confirm that you that you transformed your condititional undefined situation thanks to the definitive results, there is no reason for the economic committee to change the price, even if the economic committee like to benefit from each opportunity for decreasing price, but there is no rationale for this. [Could we get a better price?] No, it's not realistic. [WIll this negotiation be automatic, or will it have to be initiated by the manufacturer?] In practice, you have several cases of accomodational SMR, that's not the same for ASMR, but SMR is quite classical. The HAS asks you to provide the data after 2 years, or the term negotiated, and if you don't do so you lose your SMR. If you just show data to confirm the SMR, and they tell the SMR is not conditional anymore, but definitive and that's it. And mechanically, the economic committee is informed by the HAS and can decide to ask you to come to it or not. In that case, there is no rationale for changing the situation as it has been negotiated previosly. Getting a better price, that is even a little constrained because when you broaden the population, you get a lower price. The only way to get better price by adding a new indication to get a better ASMR level. In that case ASMR IV, is the same. If there is a risk in terms of pricing negotiation by adding a new indication, is to lower the price, not to increase it.

On the basis of this data, maybe the HAS would agree to say that there is a presumption of innovation, knowing that one day or another that you will show ph. III comparative data. But if the dossier is limited to that, then no, even in an early access program. [If they come with ph. III randomized, comparative data, could it help with the TC assessment and gain conditional SMR?] In that case, you are able to determine SMR and ASMR, because you have comparative data.

9,161.a,"You would get an ASMR specific to each indication. If there is a difference than you can introduce this modulation in the negotiation. And by doing the ratio by them, and they are the same, you aggregrate of course. You would distinguish each indication because the rules that apply are not the same according to the ASMR level that you get. ",DAI475
9,161.c,"So it depends on the previous indication. The best case is when you have an initial indication which got an AMSR level  1 and 3. Then it benefits European price guarantee at 5 years, which means your price cannot be decreased during this time. And if an expansion of indication comes within this period, if it is ASMR 1-3, then you get one more year of the guarantee price. ASMR IV, the period does not change. AMSR V, you reduce the period by one year. This only works with an initial AMSR of 1-3 and you are the second indication. At the 3rd indication, that doesn't work. And so they consider the level of ASMR. IF you get ASMR between 1-3, that is positive, they don't change the official price or level of net price. From ASMR IV or V, they would decrease the net price considering the extension  of population. And the official price, if you get ASMR V there is a high chance that they will decrease the official price too. But if you look at the evolution of the immunotherapies, we knw that the net price has decreased over time. With ASMR IV, price is decreased very often considering an extension of population.",DAI475
9,165.a,"If you come together, of course each indication would influence the price negotiation on the basis of its ASMR level and relatedly to its proportion in terms of population. If indication A and B have an ASMR V, and come with an ASMR III for GC, the ASMR V will pay a role. But assuming indication A and B have an ASMR 3 and the other ones have an ASMR IV, I think the the ASMR 3 would be the driver [So need to launch in ASMR3 indication first?] yes, drives threshold price. The best ASMR level when you have different indicaiton, the best ASMR level drives the official price. That is a kind of implicit rule. Then the net price will be discussed in proportion at proportion of the different ASMR levels and  if you have ASMR 1-3 in  the first two indications and are most important in terms of target population.... There is practically no influence of the others in terms of net discussion because it's only 10% of the whole population. It's difficult because there is no rule saing that ytour net price for the first  indications and then will decrease. But I think if you get a good ASMR for the first 2 indications it will help a lot. Sequencing opens more risk to the 2nd indication because there is a specific rendevous.  If first 2 indications are the good and important ones in terms of target pop, the 2 small ones after wont jeopradise the price too much. Better to bring to market together than sequence [I think they will have to sequence so NSCLC comes last]",DAI475
9,170,"[Do you have any assumptions on the ASMR in indication A?] I do not think that we have this? We are evaluating based on an hypothetical product. Again, there is a case if indication A got an ASMR between 1 and 3, then it is protected by the European price guarantee, and if you are coming within this period, if one of these indications have an ASMR for 1-3 then you can extend the period by 1  year. The guarantee of price is applied on the net price, which was not the case previously, it was only on the official price. That is not the case anymore. It's really conservative. You get the same condition of price. Because of course the net price will not be moved. Then there is specificity that you come with 2 indications. The rules state for one added indication. So the second one could be challenged here. But if you are not in this case where you have ASMR 1-3 for the first indication, then they would considered the target population of the two new indications. It's an important driver for decreasing the net price. The law states that your price is to be related the importance of the target population. The more the volumes, and supported less, the lower the price has to be. The second consideration is the level of ASMR in indicaiton B and gastric cancer. If you get ASMR IV in both indications, I think that you can negotiatie stability of your official price, and decrease on the net price, considering the importance of the added population. If the added population is very small, there is no reason for decreasing the price. If it is important, you have to take consequence of that on the net price. And for ASMR V, you will have to decrease, and will even affect the offication price. So again if you get for the extension, ASMR between 1-3, even pronounce the the stability of your preexisting condition price. If you are in the situation where the price got the guarantee, or if you have ASMR 1-3 they do not touch anthing. With ASMR IV, they will only touch net price and not list price. With ASMR V,  they will touch net price and list price.",DAI475
9,171,"Good sequence because better to get lower value afterwards. You could, itâ€™s a good sequence - high level of pricing indication with A, not jeopradise them with the indications, the second one in GC.

Maybe can follow with the same special price for the first 3 indications then have a discussion with the fourth indication. It's not bad. It's a good strategy.

Putting these 2 trials together, there are 2 major weaknesses - the first is the trial pop and ORR as primary EP, second is SAT and ORR as primary EP. Putting this together will I be convinced? Probably no, not convinced. Will I reimburse? Yes, maybe  I will reimburse even with all these important weaknesses  because of the unmet need despite the weaknesses [reimburse both?] I think I will reimburse in 3L, not in 2L but I will ask for some additional data, if possible a trial or RWE or a pragmatic trial to have some confirmation of the efficacy in 3L after receiving herceptin in the previous lines [there would be QoL data, does that change anything?]  It depends on the results. I know the results of QoL, these patients are in a lot of pain, they can't eat and have bloating. They are in poor condition. If you have PFS longer (5 months instead of 3) I know the QoL if you use gastric-specific QoL, it will be a bit better. QoL in this type of cancer has low added value. Today is you don't put QoL you are unedgy(?) so have to put QoL on everything. Give me PFS OS and I know what will be the life of these patients but they have to provide that because if they dont...",DAI475
10,13,"You have in the treated arm an increase of 30% in grade 3, you go from 55 to 85%. It is not easy and right. I will reimburse because I have a high need for a drug in this area, but I'm not satisfied. I want to reimburse but not satisfied so I will be rude in my score - SMR moderate and ASMR V. [for both?] I focus on OS - 2L OS 12 months, 3L logically in poor condition, had 1  more previous line, OS 12 months. This is strange. Normally, longer OS in 2L strategy than 3L strategy. So I'm not convinced by Trial B ( 2L trial) even if it is the right population. The control arm is missing which makes it impossible to analyse and on slide 5 you see at least 1000 patients in EU per year. They all die after 1 year, the incidence and prevalence is close. 1000 patients in EU per year and 2-3000 in the US, I don't know why control trial was not done. To the question ""Do you accept single arm?"" I accept if you explain to me why done. I don't know why i would want to be kind to a company which was not kind to the patients by proposing a drug with no strong quality in the evidence. [would you reimburse in 2L?] no, insufficient ASMR. At the end of the day the patient will be able to receive the drug in the next line. Trial A will be reimbursed for 3L.

10,14.a,"[what if EMA say trial B piivotal and A supportive, will that make difference on TC assessment?] No, never understood the difference between the supportive and pivotal. You cant have pivotal with single arm. There is no dossier with A and B, you have an indication with A and another with B and you can't put that together. As you know For TC, each indication has a specific evaluation, they will evaluate trial B 2L and trial A 3L",DAI475
10,20,"[ASMR in 3L is against physicians choice?] yes, strategy, intratherapeutic strategy. Maybe an ASMR 4 because of HR of 0.6 in OS which is quite good but by giving an ASMR moderate you say I'm not happy with your development plan. If SMR moderate for an IV drug, would mean the drug not on liste en sus [would you do it?] there are severla levels of decision making and they dont consider each other. When the company says if you give us SMR moderate we won't be on the liste en sus, nobody will be able to use it - the TC will answer ""this is not my problem. Go to see the CEPS for your price. Your dossier is not good enoguh to allow possibility of SMR important. TC will say I don't want to know. If you want SMR important, give us a good development plan not in exclusively Asian patients without ORR as primary EP and maybe patients who didn't receive a HER2 targeted therapy in a previous line. This is unacceptable it is your fault.""",DAI475

Unfair as possible in some centres. In oncology, if you reach CEC, they can pay for expensive drugs outside the liste en sus because they are rich  which is not very fair.",DAI475

Since it's  a rare situation, if I can offer 4 more months of OS with HR of 0.6, I'm ready to pay. 40K a year, which means 3-4K list a month is acceptabler [I think the PFS is 5 months, does that increase your willingness to pay? And is it price per month, course, year?] In this poor prognosis situation, price per month is okay. [If you're telling me you're ready to pay 30-40K per year and patients stay on it for 6-7 months, which works out to 6-7K a month, would you be willing to pay that?] In the previous slide I said aroun d 4K per month.",DAI475

10,89.a,"It's right [Any limitations? Nothing targeted for HER2, any thoughts?] I don't know what the practice is but I'm sure if HER2 tested and clearly positive, I'm sure phyisican would prescribe herceptin off label. Only for logical reasons, not for evidence based reasons. If expression of HER2 have to try it. In the case with KRAS in the lung and gastric, it it not magic bullet to have targeted therapy. Can be targeted with no added value so each new situation with new mutation needs to conduct a specific trial",DAI475

10,100,"The problem is it is single arm. Of course much rarer to be HER2 in the lung than in the gastric. I understand that it is difficult but when you can find 100 patients in Trial 1 and 50 in Trial 2, 50 / 50 is much better than a single arm trial with 100 patients! This is really a major limitation. It's a phase 2, open, single arm. Trial 1 is only the introduction to Trial 2. Trial 2 is the same population and I can see they probably did not receive HER2-specific therapy prior. [to put an off-label drug ina clinical trial would be difficult] Maybe can be done on retrospective study, go back to some cohort and some patients who are HER2+ and which of them received HER2 before. What is the practice? If you show me in 2018 - 2022 all patients not tested for HER and if positive did not receive HER2 targeted therapy its okay. But if I observe that in usual pathology tests in lung cancer HER2 is tested and if positive receive a targeted therapy, I will be confused. Nevertheless, I don't accept single arm.",DAI475
10,104,"[Trial 1 and Trial 2 evidence is available, but only the dosing for trial 2 will be recommended per the EMA label. Would the different doses impact your evaluation?] Initially, into the pre-read, trial 1 was only a safety trial with no efficacy results. Now, both give the same magnitude of efficacy (OS: 16/17 months). Then, the Transparency Commission will only consider the dose recommended by the EMA : 5.4mg/Kg. Trial 1 (larger) will be supportive but only the 5.4mg dose will be reimbursed
[How will you consider evidence across the 2 studies in the payer evaluation of the drug?] The major issue remains : no control arm! This could lead to NO REIMBURSEMENT (SMR insufficient). Only if the clinician are very very impressed by the 16 months of OS, a reimbursement might be possible with a poor evaluation and scoring : SMR moderate or weak and ASMR V = not on the ""list en sus"" in this indication. A H2H RCT versus usual chemo +/- PD1i +/- Herceptin is mandatory. A trial with two arms 50 and 50 patients is much better than a single arm 100 patients.",DAI475

Seems to be a good response rate but in single arm I cant say anything so I will not reimburse. Maybe I could accept conditional reimbursement with SMR moderate ASMR5, not on the liste en sus if I have some guarantee from the company there will be a phase 3 RCT conducted, if not I will not reimburse [Do you think they  could get an early access programme on acces precoce based on what you see here?] Not with the phase 3 trial ongoing or... if they say this is the whole package it will not be reimbursed even in the acces precoce. If HER2 systematically tested in lung cancer, today they would probably receive herceptin off-label. If the FR practicioner does that, no emergency to reimburse this one. Because the day we reimburse, systematically physician will ask for HER2 testing in the biopsy and systematicall if positive this will lead to prescription of this product. With such a low low low level of evidence we don't want to promote use of this product largely. It's never largely since it's a rare situation but systematically  in our xxx patients. [What if included in ESMO guidelines?] Not enough. guidelines are there to give some support on the evaluation of the dossier, not to replace it",DAI475
10,149,"If we have to have a price comparator has to be herceptin but since not approved here then drugs at 4K a month could be the price comparators. I don't think we need to talk about price if not reimbursed, if not reimbursed there will be no price",DAI475

10,157,"[If another trial in phase 3, bit broader in 1L and comparative, could there by conditional approval?] Unlogical to say yes but I will say yes. If some evidence in 1L you will use it in 1L and if you use in 1L you will not resume and use again in 2L. When you fail you fail and move to a different drug in 2L. The need for evidence in 2L disappears if drug used in 1L. Waiting for that, it is usual, it has been done in lymphoma and myeloma to say you have weak data in 2L and 3L, dont want to reimburse but can give SMR moderate and ASMR 4 or 5. If really we are sure the phase 3 will give the answer on the correctly conducted randomised trial. [if the EMA approved this trial, would that impact outcome?] if they accept the 1L, the company will have to ask for reimbursement in 1L. Of course you will consider 2L, 3L data later but if the 1L trial is already accepted by EMA it will be in 1st. [will it trigger a reassessment if submit trial 1 and 2 then this one] each new EMA label will mean a re evaluation of the new indication. If question is Does not lead systematically to reeval of 2L. The answer is no, you can keep it.

10,168.m,"[Exhibit 8 - sequence 1 Price renegotiation?] It depends on the ASMR in the indication A. I say that for GC they will have moderate 5 or maybe 4 or if they have phase 3 they will be SMR important 3,4? Depends on scientific evidence in indication A and B. The driver of price is ASMR, If ASMR for A was 1 or 2, of course with ASMR4, decrease in price. If it was also an ASMR 4, the fact that you had indication B, what is B? [another indication] so A 4000, B 4,400 [B and gastric is 4,400] [move to sequence 4, thinking of launching one by one and you have size of pops indication by indication] You have 2 previous measure indication at 4000 then 400 with gastric and 300 with lung. It means it's  5% added pop, the price will not change - we do not care about 5-10% increase. The list price wont change, net price may be a bit lower as the drug is probably less efficient in gastric and lung cancer and the evidence is poor but 300-400 patients on top of 4000 patients is nothing. Could be a 5% discount but not more than that [Exhibit 9 - if I'm the manufacturer and I want to protect my price, what should I do because my sense is in sequence 1 you're launching B which is a big pop so my thinking would be CEPS would say okay I check B and and GC, that's about 4500 patients, therefore I decrease price accordingly. With sequence 4 they will not decrease the price too much when adding GC because small pop so what should they consider?] Our advice on timing is never followed, but nevertheless, in this situation specifically, I think it's not very important because of the small pop increase we don't care. There is no... sequence 4 puts you in a difficult position as come with strong indication B after a weakening indication gastric cancer so I think maybe better to have A and B first (sequence 1 and 2) between sequence 1 and 2 I don't care.",DAI475
10,176,"Gastric cancer has limited options so ready to accept what is unacceptable in lung. Even with 300 patients, a control trial with 50/50 is better than a trial with 100 patients in single arm.

In a trial in spinal atrophy in young kids, they conduct a trial with intrathecal injection with a sham injection in young boys of 1 year old. 12 treated, 12 controlled, it was enough to get ASMR of 2 because evidence was strong. Why did they not do that? Their drug is probably not good. 12 is enough if you have very good evolution in the treated group. The evidence was clear. Here is you gain 2-3 months it's not enoguh so they don't want to do the trial because with the small pop size will not get statistical significance. No good evidence, no good ASMR, no good price. Conduct a European retrospective survey to look at the practice, do we look at HER2 in lung cancer? If not, 1L without herceptin is acceptable. Do we test HER2 in FR today?

In FR, at the end of the CT opinion there is ASMR rating. ASMR increases versus a comparator so in single arm not able to do that. So CT wont be able to give an opinion. Payers are bound to CT opinion. They can say maybe it's good but the question is always Is the new product better than the previous one? If clear that the new product is not better, the product has to be cheaper. That's the law. If the product is better e.g. higher reponse, it can propose a premium but with a single arm you can only do an indirect comparison. [so if they submited indirect comparison, seems that's not sufficient to overcome the study limitations] I don't know the natural history of the disease, but with the limited number of patients from a payer POV its difficul to perform indirect comparisons and have strong evidence.

Possible to say in 3L it's ASMR 4 and ASMR 5 in 2L. [seems like it might be ASMR insufficient in 2L with single arm trial?] could be, but I'm not sure.

Not SMR insufficient but maybe minor [2L therapy?] once again, the CT is not comfortable with single arm and limited number of patients, 100 is limited number of patients. And there are in the 2L possibilities of treatments and comparators. In this case ASMR insufficient maybe",DAI475
11,69,"[ASMR 4-5 in 3L and 2L insufficient, what's the price ref?] the first economic comparator is the comparator in the clinical trial. It's easy to do. If the manufacturer decides to take this comparator there is a reason. If there is a reason it's also a reason to take it as economical comparator. if in this case its pacli and irino, Idk the price of these products but could be the first economic comparator. It's a benchmark in this case. In 3L, pacli is 60 EUR irino is 130 EUR, the first price references might be 650 EUR per course but if ASMR 4 can have a premium. There is another comparator, Lonsurf, which costs 4K. In this case, I could say that could also be a comparator as the physician has the choice to treat with lonsurf or another prod so pragmatic comparator. In this case the drug pricing committee could take into consideration that pacli and irino were comparators, but prod X is in the same line as lonsurf and can be a comparator. 

[If ASMR 5 the product has to be parity to comparator?] Product has to be cheaper. Easy to do that if you have a generic of a well-known product. For this kind of product the law could be adapted and in this case I can imagine a payer saying I accepted previously in the 3L 4K per course, I could accept the same price for you entering the market. I don't know if lonsurf is better than prod X or not [For ASMR 5, prod X could have a price of 4K a course?] yes, something like that [And ASMR4?] that will be against pacli and irinotecan, so prod X can have a higher price than those two but also hypothesis that lonsurf also available for same indicaiton. ASMR 4 or 5 does not change the game, the prod will be in range of 4K per course. [So ASMR 4 is still around 4K per course?] You understand ASMR is not an absolute scale? It's a relative scale, when we say ASMR4, versus what? It's always versus what? Here, I see lonsurf has the same indication, population so same price. [Lonsurf is different because it had ASMR 5 so my understanding is list and net are the same?] normally yes, I don't know the contract here but normally the list and net are the same. [When thinking of price, do you think per course or per month? Prod X might be taken for 5 months vs lonsurf for 2 months?] Per course is the first. We compare treatments of patient not months. To obtain same activity and you have to treat for 4 months with one and another with 8 months, why change price? From payer POV, pay for efficacy whether 5 months or 10 months. That's why I say per course, the difference is just due to pharmacokinetics so price per course. We do per month for chronic diseases e.g. diabetes or hypertension but not how these products are give - per course.

[ASMR 4 vs 5 changes whether included on liste en sus, what are the implications? With ASMR4 included with 5 not.] implications in willingness of hospital to buy this product compared to another one. If you have to pay the product in your budget different to if included on liste en sus. To my knowledge, the first is the willingness of the hospital or the pharmacist in the hospital to buy it. [first for ASMR 4, do you think CEPS would seek to negotiate price volume agreement?] I don't guess. Price volume agreement is when youre afraid a product is given off label. You know some products are used for diabetes but can also be used for weightloss. One indication is on label the other is off label. Or when uncertainty on the eligible population. I don't think in this case it's the case [do you think worried about offlabel treatment of 2L patients and not just 3L if ASMR insufficient in 2L?] yes, there would be this kind of concern. Maybe to say you have ASMR insuffcient in 2L , I don't want your product to be given at same price in 2L where also there are 300 patients compared to 100 patients in 3L. You are right, there is this anxiety of the drug pricing committee [do you expect any other innovative schemes e.g. patient caps, perfomance based?] I hardly think because the prod not alone in the markt and the market can make differences between good and bad prods, so why make innovative contracting? Unless a few products not effecitve in FR, but why make the process complicated if the simple process is good. Complex or special contracts are used when there is great uncertainty in patients to be treated or for off label use but in this case not sure there's  a need",DAI475
11,79,"This trial answers all the questions I had previously. It's phase 3, It's randomised, active control, 500 patients, international population, there is a comparator, primary EP is a hard point, OS. I could say okay, all the questions I had previously are not there with this trial [If aware Trial C ongoing, would TC require resubmission with this data?] I can imagine so, they'll say we can agree on price today and change our minds according to the data from trial C. If trial C confirmed, the data on which we based our agreement, okay fine, if not then we can discuss price or market access. I imagine CT will do the same. [if conditional assessment with wanting to resubmit with this evidence, what time?] as short as possible. If trial C is ongoing when discussion ongoing vs if trial C expected to start in 2 years is different. 2 years I would say is reasonable kind of time - I could say 3-5 years is too long and I'm not sure if 1 year is feasible[if conditional assessment poss, would TC give rating for SMR and ASMR in this conditional setting? how does that work?] It works like that. TC can say based on data from manufacturer SMR 5 but it can be reassessed, we arewaiting for results from trial C, but CT and drug pricing committee are very cautious not to over-rate first [If it had a conditional assessment by the TC, there is an ASMR 5, how does drug pricing committee take into account ASMR5 in the second pop, an ASMR 4, potentially 5 in the 3L population. How do you come up with one price based on those 2 ratings and the different references between 2L and 3L?] you say that provided that ASMR 5 in the two populations [if ASMR 5 in 2L and 3L population, does that change the discussion of price from earlier?] I dont think so [why not?] It is a small number of patients, not 1 million patients a day. There are some uncertainties always in this kind of population and finally I could say that... sometimes difficult to ... doesnt change the discussion too much. Discussion based on comparator. [If it has ASMR 5 in 2L will that not include 2L prods in the discussion?] it will but 2L products which are the cost of the products in the 2L? You have price of pembro, cyramza, I don't know the price of cyramza in this pop [cyramza got an SMR moderate, ASMR 5 so didn't launch as price was going to be too low so I think it's excluded from the T2A list] Okay, and keytruda evaluation ongoing so don't know the price. So sometimes difficult because if economical comparison is pacli and irino, difficult to go up to 1K EUR [so keytruda is approved but because negotiation ongoing you wouldn't use it as a price reference?] when pembro will be on the market and evaluation and price discussion completed, possible to have a nice comparator from economic POV. [Do you think given the number of indications keytruda / pembro have, do you think it'll change much? It's a small pop and I'd expect the price to be the same] you don't know what could be the negotiation between net and list price. Drug pricing committee could say the list price stays same but ask for net price discount because in this indication dont want to pay so much. [If ASMR5  in 2L pop and ASMR5 in 3L pop, will the price change because there are now 2L references e.g. keytruda or why you look only at 3L products?] The payer always has a choice to buy or not buy, if don't buy in 3L, we have one product only, lonsurf and payer pays 4K a course. If the product enters 2L, payer doesnt want to pay more particularly if ASMR5. This is clear for 3L, for 2L not so clear as you have pacli and irino, but keytruda and cyramza are coming but I don't know the price. Ro go directly I could say keytruda and cyramzaobtain a price in 2L could be ref for prod X. [asmr rating with trial c if reassessed?] Maybe 4. ASMR 4 - I could say in this case it's a direct comparison with an indicated prod, there is statistical evidence of increase in OS so I guess it could be ASMR4 except if safety is bad or severe impairing use of product.

Can it dramatically change the volume of sales? Let's say in the first indication can treat 10K people, and new indication is 400 people, it doesnt change the global economics. Different if go from 400 patients to 1000. 

2. Is the price clearly different to what is expected in second indication. Let's say prod x already available in the market at 10K per course and in the second indication the drug pricing committee dont want to pay more than 500, In this case could be a discussion. When there is a slight or v slight increase in volume, the price doesnt change, but when the volume increases significantly, can decrease price in both indications as cant have different price in 2 indication. Another option is if drug price committee want to pay 5K per course, but the old price of the course is 4K, thats fine because less expensive so payer is happy. If there is an increase, can have a discount to say ""you are in market at 10K but I dont want to pay more than 5K so you have a discount to reimburse 5K per patient treated.""  [so on the first scenario where talk about volume of patients, if slight increase in volume do you think no additional discount?] yes [are you thinking just number of patients or volume of doses? are you accounting for the fact that previous indi taken for 10 months for certain number of people and new indi is 3 months for certain number of people?] payer does not buy per mg but efficacy. I suppose it will be based on patient treatment per course. [Second consideration around existing price versus price evaluated for new indi, you were saying if 1st price is 4K and new indi has price of 5K then payer happy to keep price at 4K?] yes [Assuming can't increase price?] payers dont like to increase the price. It's a price negotiation. Also, why to increase cost in the previous indication. I rarely think of price increase in this indicaiton [if the exsting price is 5K and standalone for new indi is lower and 4K how do you determine the price discount?] The base of discussion will be I don't want to pay for the new indication more than 4K, could be based  on register, volume, prescription. At the end of the year, you treat 100 patients reimburse for them [for new patient pop with new lower price, you expect rebates or discounts so new pop only paying 4K?] yes, I hardly imagine in this case a decrease in price particularly if volume is low [so keep price but potential for additional discount or rebating?] yes [any idea what those rebates are?] no, case by case for these kind of products.

I can imagine the price negotiation doesnt change between 1, 2 or 4 at a first glance. The huge indication drives the cost and price (A and B), your 2 other minor indications are not price relevant [for sequence 4, indication A is big and gastric launches with 400 patients, so price wouldnt change until indication B?] difficult to say, in sequence 4, the big discussion and negotiation will be when A and B enter market. I think GC and NSCLC will be a small discussion compared to B. [Do you think better to launch A and B at the same time?]  not really because everyone knows manufacturer has indication B and is preparing it. Drug committee has in mind indication A will launch and B will follow in the next month or year. When launching indication A then B at 2 years we know what's happening in 2 years as the trials are usually ongoing when manufacturers file with the EMA or FDA.

And thatâ€™s why â€“ and I donâ€™t remember exactly the rating I gave â€“ but roughly in total we have 6,000 new cases of GC per year in France and 40,000-45,000 lung cancer/breast cancer, so that the economic burden is going to be perceived as much lower than lung or breast cancer for example, or colorectal cancer",DAI475
12,4,2,DAI475
12,4.a,"well, I think the strength is that they have some kind of efficacy. The weakness is that we know as long as the patient â€“ even for the patient who receives chemotherapy â€“ we know that the benefit is quite small and we have a different type of treatment. And we know once the patient has progressed to second line, then we know that the patient will progress and then we find we have option which has some kind of effect, but first of all they are not going to cure the patient and they adverse side effects â€“ based on the kind of treatment, we may have different type of safety and tolerability . we know that the first line is platinum-based and we know well the adverse side of platinum salt. So its difficult to be more specific on such vague question. 
[ So for the second-line treatment, if weâ€™re focused specifically on HER2 positive patients, is there a second line treatment you would consider to be SoC?]
M: I think we have terrible option. Iâ€™m not sure only one has become the SoC, Iâ€™m not sure there is one single Soc, no. [So perhaps there are multiple options available?] Exactly, yes.
L: [so perhaps for third line â€“ a similar answer, or any thoughts on third line?]
M: I think for third line its even less clear. So we have clearly Lonsurf, is one chemotherapy that has been approved in this indication, that has been reimbursed. So this is something that can be used. And we also have other option that we can consider â€“ like Taxane-based chemotherapy or even irinotecan based chemotherapy if that hasnâ€™t been used previously. But then it is based on expert opinion. So that means the more we progress into the line of treatment, the less clear are the use. We know for example the combination of trastuzumab and Taxane can be used in France for early access for patient who have received second line. So clearly we have different option and we cannot say that one is really adequately the best option to be used.",DAI475
12,5.a,"3,3,4",DAI475
12,10,"I went through it. One question which strikes me â€“ we have trial A being supportive for third line plus, and the trial B is for second-line, and this is a pivotal single-arm trial, which of course is going to be of concern to me. 
L:[ So thatâ€™s just the expectation of for the EMA designation. So the EMA label would be for patients in second-line or later, and thatâ€™s our guess in terms of how this product might be designated by the EMA. I guess the question to you â€“ if the EMA does designate the trial that way, if they say B is pivotal and  A is supportive, would that change how the TC would interpret these two trials for product X?]
M: Yes. If we consider Trial B is pivotal study. So this is for second line â€“ so this is for second line, so that, in the stage, their option isnâ€™t a single option which can be considered as the gold standard of the treatment, there exists an option. And having seen on the trial is something that is going to make the TC assessment very complex. Because by the definition we need to answer the question what is the added value vs SoC. And if we have a single arm then it will be really difficult to make this assessment. And then we go to trial A which is considered supportive, which is targeting later line, or at least patient at later stage of treatment path. And in this case, we have a randomised  trial vs an active treatment, which even based on physician choice. So I think that, assessing the clinical value based on trial B â€“ and I donâ€™t know how the company wants us to analyse or use this trial â€“ to assess the clinical value of their product.",DAI475
12,11,"Iâ€™m fine with trial A. Of course, one the concern I have is that trial A has been conducted in an Asian population. And this is something â€“ if the assumption is that it is 100% Asian population â€“ of course that will be criticised because we can say that they may have some different genetic background, in terms of medication metabolism for example, treatment choices â€“ treatment choices, the management might not be exactly the same, such that we may have concern.

L: [And then a question on the Asian QoL data. So, thinking about ways to address that uncertainty. If there were French real world data, if this product were able to get early access or something like that and they had real-world data on overall survival, QoL â€“ would that address your concerns around the Asian population trial data at all?]
M: First of all, yes I do think so, because once again we always concern about the external validity and this is based on two factors as already mentioned. The fact that we may have different genetic factors, which is one of the factors. Iâ€™m not saying that that is the case, but that can be the case. The second one is if in the SoC â€“ is that the same. Because we know that if we make the comparison of medication vs SoC, and here the treatment is based on physician choice, namely irinotecan/ paclitaxel, this will indeed be of concern. Of course, if you were to have real world evidence either from France or for at least Caucasian population, or mixed population, or European population, that would be really helpful. But the point is that we know that when we have real evidences that the question is: can we be sure that the patient were the same, that the patient who were included in the trial and how can we reconcile data coming from the trial and data coming from the real world evidences.",DAI475
12,11.d,"I of course make the assumption that the secondary end-point reached statistical significance ; I think the primary end point is not of interest at all, because we donâ€™t pay for the overall response rate. The definition is for complete response, partial response, how the response was defined. But we donâ€™t care about the response if it is not a very good surrogate for what we consider to be the primary endpoint, which is overall survival. Nevertheless here we have overall survival.  Iâ€™m making the assumption that the difference has reached statistical significance. We have a HR of 0.6, four month overall survival, so roughly 50% increase. I think we are targeting third line plus patient this treatment, and of course, one other question may be is that we have some kind of safety concern â€“ because there is an extremely high proportion of grade 3+ adverse events, one drug related death, 15% discontinuation. But despite that, the overall survival is being improved. So I think we are at the margin where in fact we have a benefit in terms of overall survival, which would be considered as clinically relevant.",DAI475
12,12,"As I mentioned, I canâ€™t think anything about trial B because of the design. When you have a single arm trial; I need to have data to make some kind of comparison. I was making the comparison trial B vs trial A. And if I do that,  so meaning that we have a trial A for 3L+  patient, meaning those patient are expected to have a shorter overall survival, because they are at a more advanced stage of their disease, so meaning mOS of 12 month, the same as we have in trial A, but I can make the assumption that with best standard option, patient will have mOS being higher than the 8.5 month than we had in trial A. So that means I donâ€™t know, and I cannot tell anything about the added medical value, what is the improvement offered by product X in second line patients. And my expectation is that company will at least come with some kind indirect comparison with EU data. But honestly Im not understanding the rationale for not going for RCT with an active comparator for trial B.",DAI475
12,12.b.i,"So as we discussed, this is for second line, so I think I wouldâ€™ve like to see the treatment which has been approved, that can be used, like cytotoxic chemotherapy using Taxane or irinotecan. 
L: [I think the difficulty is and Iâ€™m not sure if this impacts your perceptions though, but Iâ€™m not sure if Ramucirumab (or Cyramza) , I donâ€™t think its reimbursed.]
M: Ramucirumab, the medical value was not sufficient to be granted market access in France. Pembro was shown not to be more effective than second line chemotherapy. The follow-up of trastuzumab in second line, that was an Asian study, and was not found to be effective. And for the combination of trastuzumab deruxtecan, Iâ€™m not sure that it has already been assessed. So honestly, that is true that at this stage, what we consider as being second line option is chemotherapy using Taxane or in combination either with 5-FU. so that means you can have the combination of (5-FU?) and irinotecan.  So we have something that can be used and we have definitely a second line option.

[L: and then, for trial B you mentioned indirect treatment comparison. If data, if indirect treatment comparison data were provided that showed how product X compared to some of the standard of care options in second line, is that indirect treatment comparison data valuable to the TC in their assessment, does it make a difference? What are you thoughts there?]
M: Well this is a very weak demonstration of the benefit. And in fact, it may even, the point is that we need to have a comparison by definition, because we cannot make our assessment without that comparison. Because once again the law in France to be listed a product as either to offer additional medical benefit or allow for some saving. So then by definition we have to say that it is better than or cheaper than. And so if you come with an indirect comparison, then that means you recognise there are standard option, there are existing options, and the best way to really assess the benefit vs the existing option is to go into RCT. That can be accepted, but the level of evidence would be really, really low. [Its almost like they are acknowledge there are other comparators by submitting the indirect treatment comparison as well]. Yes, exactly.",DAI475

12,16.c.i,"I would rate it as moderate therapeutic improvement â€“ this would be between two and three. Because the net clinical benefit, when considering the improved overall survival and the increased frequency of adverse events. ",DAI475
12,16.e,"But the question I have is that at what cost does it come in terms of safety? This is why what I think is missing here is QoL â€“ I would like to see QoL measurement, to make sure that patient will not have had a an impaired QoL because of the safety profile.
L[ Ok, I have a couple of follow ups. I question for the QoL data. If QoL was collected for trial A, is it an issue at all that trial A is an open label. I guess trial A and B are both open-label. Would you still QoL data valuable if they were collected from both trials?]
M: because of the open label design?
L:[ yes, if QoL measurements were included in design for trial A or B, is it that acceptable, valuable, do you have any concerns that it is an open label trial in terms of the value of the quality of life data.]
M: I donâ€™t think so.  donâ€™t think I have concern. Even if it is a open-label design, I would like to see QoL measurements. 
L: [My last follow up to what you said â€“ on quality life evidence that you were wanting to see. Are you wanting to see that quality of life is better compared to the control arm, or just not worse?]
M: Ideally I would like to see the quality of life to be improved, but at least Iâ€™m expecting quality of life not to be impaired by the treatment. Because once again we are getting four months in min, which is significant compared to the overall survival with standard of care. But we want to have our patient living four months longer with an acceptable QoL. ",DAI475
12,19.a,"Just to make sure â€“ for the study in third line plus, that mean patient in third line, and for second line, but that this was strictly restricted to second line, or that was second line plus? [Its only second line]. So we have two well separated populations, and yes we would make the assessment for the two different populations. And my guess is that we can make an assessment that the SMR would be important for second line â€“ no, third line sorry. The ASMR will be IV, I think based once again on the combination of efficacy and safety profile. For second line, of course, I may revise my position looking at some kind of indirect comparison vs what is the way patients are being managed,  because once again, just to come back to the discussion we had previously on providing real data and comparing them to these data and saying that, in fact, they acknowledge that there is something no, if they can provide data showing that when patients are receiving second mind option, in fact, it doesn't work, then it can do they can justify to go for single-arm pricing. Ok, we know that physicians are treating patients with existing options, but these options are totally ineffective. And that is what was driving us to go for a non-randomized clinical trial because we had the feeling that because of the knowledge of the molecule, including patient XXX (Â think â€œadversityâ€) vs the existing option would have been ethically acceptable. So, if I were to have data supporting the fact that second-line patient have, let's say, 5 months overall survival and here they have a 12 month, then I may be pleased and may be able to rate. With what have, I will say that for 2L the SMR will be insufficient.",DAI475
12,19.b,"[L: If that data, that explanation that you just went over, if that were provided, what ASMR or what SMR rating would you expect?]
M: So then we can expect an SMR rating important. And the SMR rating will of course depend of the magnitude of benefit vs what is the overall survival of the patient and the standard approach.

[L: And then for the third line population that we talked about â€“ so the Asian trial data as well as real world evidence, potentially from an early access in France â€“ you were saying SMR important and ASMR 4. Can I just get your thinking behind the SMR important - why it would be important and not moderate?]
M: Because I think that you have as a ratio of 0.6 in terms of overall survival, which is, I think, quite significant. The question have, you know, it's about the safety. So I think that this improvement is significant in terms of as a ratio, but I think it may also be considered significant in terms of absolute improvement in terms of month. So, this is four months. The point is that the uncertainty is about to safety profile. I'm going back to that, because once again, I'm not sure that this four month can really be considered as a gain if the quality of life is really too bad in the active treatment part. The example that I had was for a Tarceva in metastatic pancreatic cancer, which was granted market approval by the EMA and was denied market access in France because the improvement in terms of overall survival was not even a month and the safety profile was really bad. So I don't know how the safety profile will be assessed and so I will say that I will either vote for SMR important or insufficient but I don't think that SMR moderate makes sense. 
[Then why doesn't it make sense? ]
M: Because of the magnitude of benefit in terms of overall survival.
[Ok, thatâ€™s clear. And then if there's other follow-up questions. Ok, so with an SMR important, which is what we're expecting, and an ASMR IV, it would be included on the liste en sus?]
M: Yes, that can maybe be on the listee n sus.",DAI475
12,20.a,"[I guess one question, because in second line, we were anticipating an SMR insufficient. Do you think it's possible that the manufacturer would submit for reimbursement only in third line where they have firmer data?] M: Yes, of course [And then they would wait to submit in second line until they have a head to head data to support that. Or would given they know the TC knows trial A and B has been conducted, do you think the TC would require them to submit in second line and third line?]
M: No, not at all. It's choice by the company the company has the right to seek reimbursement only for third line - this is their choice. And I think this may be the best way. And they enter a later line. So with a narrower population? And I think this would be well accepted because once again, this is where the level of evidence is the highest and then they can they can come later on saying that they will provide more convincing data.",DAI475
12,69,"I think Lonsurf â€“ so Lonsurf has been approved in this third line population. So I think that it can be considered as a price benchmark. [So, If we go to slide 7: it has some of the prices in gastric cancer for these agents. I guess one question - so right now we have assumed approximately a 40% discount from the list price to the net price, with the exception of Lonsurf. I believe that got an ASMR V, so we were assuming that the list price is equal to the net price. Is this understanding generally aligned with your expectations in terms of the list to net price of some of these agents, just at a high level?]
M: So it's difficult because net price most of the time is not being made public, which make things more complicated, but I think that's ithis is , yes, my assumption - I think it is correct, yes.",DAI475
12,73,"[When also we're thinking about this new Product X, we're thinking about maybe Lonsurf as the price reference. What metric do you use when you're thinking about price? So do you think about it in terms of price per month, price per year, price just for the course of therapy - so if the PFS is only five months, the course of therapy would be five months?]
M: No, we are thinking in in terms of price to manage a patient on a yearly basis. So even if a patient has been been treated for two months, it means that in year 2023 this patient will have cost to the healthcare insurance, this cost - so we are considering the yearly cost for a patient.

When also we're thinking about this new Product X, we're thinking about maybe Lonsurf as the price reference. What metric do you use when you're thinking about price? So do you think about it in terms of price per month, price per year, price just for the course of therapy - so if the PFS is only five months, the course of therapy would be five months?
M: No, we are thinking in in terms of price to manage a patient on a yearly basis. So even if a patient has been been treated for two months, it means that in year 2023 this patient will have cost to the healthcare insurance, this cost - so we are considering the yearly cost for a patient.
L: Ok, so in that example, if the patient only takes the treatment for two months, and the treatment is $1,000 per month, the cost that you're thinking about is $2,000 not $12,000?
M: Exactly. That is going to be 2,000 euros, yes of course. 
L: So I know there's a lot of different metrics and honestly, it's easier to sometimes just use numbers as an example so that I'm clear. OK, so we have below on this table, we have the net price per course. So for example, for Lonsurf that might only be given for around two months based on the PFS in the trial - so the price per year would only be 4000. 
M: Yes, that is the case because you know, we are considering the yearly budget impact for a given medication. So that means that's how many patients we treat in a given year and multiplied by the number of months they are being treated. So, once again, if we treat patients for only two months with these indication or Lonsurf for example, because patients will be treated for 2 months Then that is the price that will be considered for yearly budget impact analysis. And of course, when we are going to make the estimation of the annual budget impact, we are going to make some kind of weighted mean average of the number of months patient will be treated, because you say, ok, its two months  - that is two months in mean, but we don't know if that is the mean or in median, but it is something that will be quite easy to calculate. Of course we need to know for how long the patient will survive and for how long they will they will be treated.,L: So considering all of that, what price would you expect to be negotiated for Product X?
M: For third line [Yes]? I will say that ,you know that when Lonsurf was assessed the ASMR rating was V and the SMR was moderate, so I think that if we make the assumption that the SMR is going to be IV ,which can be the case because once again for Lonsurf the improvement in terms of overall survival was 2.1 month. Here we have something that is better. So really, I think the ASMR IV is likely. I think that 20% on top of Lonsurf is something which makes sense, so that mean you make the assumption to 2.1 thousand euros -  I think that something like 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 makes sense.
L: Ok, so the cost per month is 2.1,  but the cost per course is 4.2. So what, did they look at the cost per course and think ok: 4.2 a 20% improvement off of, or 20% premium, maybe 5000 for the whole course? [M: Exactly, yes] Ok, so this product, if the course for this product X is five months, then really it's only 1000 euros per month, which is actually cheaper than Lonsurf on a monthly basis.
M: I think so. I think that once again, we can still have a price per course, which is going to be 20% on top of Lonsurf, meaning that we may end up with a price which is going to be higher, just because if we calculate the price per patient which is going to be higher because patient having to get longer treatment. Really, I think that it can make sense. Even if we can say ok, because of the fact that patients would have to be to stay longer meaning that in total the net price per course is going to be higher with Product X than it is with Lonsurf. We can open in the price negotiations say -  instead of having 20% and being priced at 2400 euros, that we only need to 2300 and 2200 euros, meaning that by the end the total cost will be higher because of the longer treatment period. But I think it is something that is maybe way too complicated. And my guess is that to the 20% maybe on the list price per course.
L: So then, what about the second line population if it receives an SMR insufficient, what would you expect? In terms of price?
M:If the product isn't sufficient, the product will not be reimbursed, so no discussion of price.",DAI475
12,79,"L: [So let's go to a new exhibit. So if we go to slide 20, we have an exhibit showing trial C.  This is trial C - it's the same product X and now it's a head-to-head trial. And it's in second-line  and its vs Cyramza plus Paclitaxel. What are your thoughts on trial C?]
M: Well, so the question is that we have a benefit, we have a substantial benefit vs Ramucirumab. But the point is that, as you mentioned, when it was assessed, the TC considered the benefit was not high enough and market access was denied.  So we have a comparison vs something which was not considered an effective medication in this indication. 
L:[ I think the actual TC rating for the combination of Cyramza plus Paclitaxel was actually SMR moderate, ASMR V.] M:Yes, yes [So I don't think it was insufficient, and it might have just been a decision not to launch or something by the manufacturer. ]
M: So the point is SMR was moderate in combination with Paclitaxel. And as monotherapy was insufficient. So even though, I think that the benefit was considered as not that high, and so I have to go back to the trial design to make sure â€“ so if we consider that this is a valid option, then we have once again  an HR of 0.7, which is a HR  being considered as the threshold weâ€™re expecting to see. Iâ€™m not really considering PFS, because when we have OS, PFS is pointless. Iâ€™m also not really discussing the overall response rate. And then I'm interested in the safety data, because even I think that the difference may not reach statistical significance and there are less Grade 3 and plus treatment adverse events: 75% vs 82%. I think that at least we don't have a very negative signal in terms of safety. So we have a product which is apparently, unless I missed something, at least as well to rate it as combination of Ramucirumab plus Paclitaxel, with 5 months, 4.6 months improvement in overall survival, is a ratio of 0.7. Once again, my only concern I have is that I need to make sure, which is not the case, that Ramucirumab plus Paclitaxel will indeed be considered the most appropriate clinical comparator.
L:[ I guess if it's considered appropriate comparator, as long as it didn't receive, if it did receive SMR moderate, ASMR V, do you think it would be accepted or what else is your concern with it being an accepted comparator?]
M: I think that we didn't say that this was not a good medication. We just confirmed that in fact, we're not sure that the benefit was really significant. And really looking at the benefits vs the gain was 1.5 months in terms of absolute gain, in terms of overall survival, was 1.5 months which of course, and that was real. I think the question that, maybe the question I have is whether or not we may consider that there are other options which will have been used and I'm not sure this is the case. I think that once again maybe the best standard of care would have been the combination of 5-FU? plus irinotecan.",DAI475
12,79.a,"L: [I have a question: if it's TC was aware that trial C was ongoing, do you think conditional HTA  assessment could be provided for Product X with the requirement to submit this trial C  - like an initial conditional assessment with the requirements to submit this this data when it's available. M:you mean based on the results from the open label study trial B?. [So if trial A and B were completed and they submitted for reimbursement and they were asking, we have trial B right now, its single arm and in second line. Can you get a conditional assessment, knowing that this trial C is coming and will and will submit this data for trial C?] 
M: No, I doubt that because I think that - I was discussing whether not to comparator of Ramucirumab plus Paclitaxel is the good one. And I don't know that. And if I go for comparison vs Trial B and Trial C,  in trial B, the overall survival was roughly 12 month with Product X, and here we have an overall survival which is 10.8 months with Ramucirumab plus Paclitaxel, meaning we have a 1.2 month which is not going to be significant. So I think that what I'm saying is that I'm not sure that that trial B will be sufficient. I think that we may even say ok, even if we even if the company is saying the thing will come with trial C -  of course it depends on when they're expecting to submit results from trial C. But it's not like when you submit a dossier with overall survival that has not been measured and say I already have PFS measurement, some kind of safety, we may even have a trend for overall survival, so that are not mature but they will be,  so we ask for conditional reimbursement because we think that it will not be ethical to wait and not to provide access to the patient. In this case, I'm not sure, I think that we have a single arm trial, whereas we couldâ€™ve expected an RCT. We know that RCT that is coming is going to be vs an comparator which was not considered as being. outstanding. So I think that the conditional reimbursement is going to be really challenging.
L: [And just a quick follow up when you're talking about the timing, what is generally the time requirement for that follow- on resubmission of the data?]
M: I don't think we have we have a magic threshold. I think that we are expecting to see results, let's say within one or two years at best. That if they were coming with Trial B, and saying but as soon as we have been granted market access, we'll be starting trial C. No, it does not work. It will not work. If they need one year or when you have to put that data to reach maturity, then that can be the case but once again, to grant conditional market access, we need to have the perception that first of all there is an unmet need, and we already have data supporting the fact that this medication is quite likely to feed at least part of this unmet medical need. And that not granting market access and giving access to the patient to this medication will be associated with a waste of chance.",DAI475
12,81.a,"L: [So for this trial C,  if the data becomes available, and the TC assesses this product X is based on the new trial C, what would you expect for the new SMR and ASMR ratings? ]M:For the second line only?. [Yes]
M: I think that I would make the same rating. I will say that the SMR is important as a ratio of 0.7, 4.6 month in absolute improvement in terms of overall survival, and that is not 4.6 months on top of five years. This is 4.6 months, on top of a 10.8 months, with a safety profile which appears to be acceptable. And the SMR rating we said will be IV - because once again even if we have some benefit, which may be considered as clinically relevant, I don't think that this will be perceived as being outstanding in terms of improved overall survival.",DAI475
12,82,"L: [So if some guy so let's say, they launched first with trial A and B was insufficient. So the price is driven by A, and you resubmit and they have this new assessment based on trial C in second line which is SMR important ASMR IV, what happens to the price? Is the price then reassessed - what would you expect for the price with this trial C?]
M: So the price will by definition be reassessed. That is for sure, because we have a new population , different sides of the population. I think that if we have a broader population with an SMR rating, which is going to be the same as the one in the previous line. So that in that we are still at SMR important ASMR IV, then I think that we can only expect the price to be reduced. Because once again,  the size of the population will be increased. If of course it depends on for how long the medication will have been on the market, with a previous indication. It depends also on what is the magnitude of the increase in the size of the target population. I think that the reduction, the price reduction may not be that significant, if we have the product with the same perception of benefits, so ASMR IV, but  I think there will be some kind of price erosion, and maybe what is likely is that the price erosion will not be that high in terms of list price - maybe, let's say only 5%. And then the pricing committee may ask for a more significant discount â€“ so a net price which will be more significantly reduced than the list price.
L:[ So if the price was - like we said 2.2 or 2.5 thousand per month and it's being reassessed, you would expect it to be lower even though the price references of Cyramza for example, or some of the other second line products like Keytruda are obviously a lot higher,  you would still expect the price to be decreased from 2.2?]
M: Well yes, this is one of my expectation. I'm not saying this is the Procedure. I think as I told you that the price, my expectation is that the price reduction would not be that high. So if we considered the price would be 2.5 for the third-line and we extend to the second round, we may only go down to 2.4 for example. We need to consider that the fact that we,  so once again, I don't know exactly what will be the target population, because of course missing a significant impact. So for third line I think that you discussed a few 100 of patient",DAI475

12,100,"M: I think that so for  Trial A,  only safety data will be submitted. Ok. So that I will not consider Trial 1. And to me if you provide only the safety data, this is a phase I trial so I cannot make assessment not balancing the risk and the benefit. So will clearly not consider trial 1. For trial 2, the issue I have is that once again no comparison. You mentioned that median overall survival of 16 months without giving me the confidence interval, because this is a very small study: 50 patient and in this case will questioned the robustness.  So once again you are showing that this patient have a median overall survival of 16 months. Is it better or worse than what they could have or not have received if they had not been included in the trial.
L:[ So you're saying you want comparison vs no treatment?] 
M: Iâ€™m just saying if I donâ€™t have comparison, I canâ€™t make assessment. 
L: [Would indirect treatment comparisons be valuable at all?]
M: If we have no other option, yes, that is the way we're going to work, but once again, by definition  we need to be able to make some kind of comparison, even in that is acces precoce for example, or observational , whatever you want, but we need  = 16 months, I don't know if this is good or bad.",DAI475
12,110,"I guess first, with this data, would you expect product X to meet the criteria for an early access program?
M: You know, I don't have enough knowledge of the natural history of second line NSCLC. So, based on what I've been what I've been provided, I cannot answer this question. I think that I have to make some assumptions, and whether the assumption is that 16 months for unresectable or metastatic may not be that bad. So, clearly, we know that this is a very poor prognosis cancer. So this is something that may occur. But clearly based on what I see on slide 22, I can actually not say yes or no.
,L: [So based on the data that is provided, would you expect SMR insufficient or a different outcome from the TC?]
M: So, once again, you are not providing me enough data to make and to answer this question. This will really- this is this will not be the dossier which will be submitted.  You cannot say Iâ€™ve reach 16 months, and Iâ€™m not saying anything of how long the patient will have survived managed by their treating physicians. Even for the market approval. I'm not saying that the signal arm trial is not acceptable; I'm suggesting that even if you go for single arm trial, then you can say taking what we know about the disease,  there is some kind of of benefit. Once again, remember that you have 50% of a drug related adverse event. So, I cannot answer your question.
L: [I suppose if there were in-drug treatment comparisons that were provided, in the same dossier with this evidence, and it showed a benefit, what outcome would you expect there, or what would you what data would you need to see in order to not get an SMR insufficient. ]
M: I think that we need to have benefit in terms of medium OS being at least statistically significant. And because you know I was looking at for example, acetinib (?)  in some type of patients with NSCLC and the benefit in terms of overall survival was 3.8 months and the ASMR was V. So, once again, this was for one indication. So to answer your question, I would like to see , I was trying to find some data on the absolute survival - sorry if I'm taking too much of your time. So  I think that 16 month is something that is that is quite significant. And I think that the company has to, to suggest and to show that that is way better than what was observed with the other medication, once again in the assessment of zicadia (?) the median overall survival was 5.4 month in the group treated by acetinib (?), and 1.6 months in the group receiving chemotherapy. So the benefit was 3.8 months. But starting going from 1.6 and ending at 5.4. So I think that once again, those are not exactly the same patient, but I think that 16 month indication is of interest. So they definitely should try to provide data and convince that  even if this is through an indirect comparison, there is at least strong suggestion of the fact that this treatment may be beneficial for the patient.
L:[ If that data was provided, what SMR and ASMR rating would you anticipate?]
M: Well, once again, we have a very small study, trial 2 - 50 patient. As an indirect comparison, I think that the SMR will be important, and once again the ASMR will be IV at best, and I think that this may be reassessed once the company resubmit more robust evidences.",DAI475
12,110.a,L:[ What data would you want to see?] Or what data do you think should be provided in order to increase the potential for an early access program like an in-drug treatment comparison? [Yes]. ,DAI475
12,149,"So they did they receive an SMR important, ASMR V, what price do you think would be negotiated? Let's say a standalone indication, it hasn't launched anywhere else, what price do you think would be negotiated?
M: Once again, no, no idea. This is a standalone, they have not been compared to any of the medication.
L: [And the prices also for your reference on slide 14. We have some prices from other products in NSCLC 
M: I think that's a price similar to the price for Opdivo makes sense]. Ok, so those like dark gray on the left hand side? [Yes.]
L:[ Do you think a price up to the price of Keytruda can be supported or more like 3000s?]
M: No, I think that I think that the price of Ketruda makes sense. I think yes. Even that maybe the overall margin,  but I think that it makes sense. This is for second line therapy, I will suggest that the benefit may be considered as quite the same.",DAI475
12,152,"L:[ Do you think a price up to the price of Keytruda can be supported or more like 3000s?]

12,162,"So I want to ask a couple questions just around indication expansion and how different launch sequencing might impact your perception. So I guess first just when there is a price renegotiation or an indication expansion, is there any sort of minimum price discount or threshold that is expected with indication expansion or could the price be maintained after indication expansion or could it actually increase if the value is really high in the next indication
M: Once again, Iâ€™ve not been involved personally in the pricing decision, Iâ€™ve not been a member of the pricing committee. But based on my knowledge, I read that that the price increase is something that is which can be quite unlikely. Of course, it may depend on for how long the medication has been on the market, what was the requested size of the initial population and things like this, but I think that price increases quite unlikely. Once again, unless you go from the ASMR IV for the first indication to ASMR III or II in the other one. In this case, yes maybe. Otherwise, I think that this is almost 100% sure that price discount will be negotiated. As I told you, the price erosion may be limited in terms of list price, and more significant in terms of net price. If the increased population is not that high, or that big, and if the benefit is the identical volume is considered as being significant for the second indication, then we can we can have cases where the price will be maintained, but really I think that price discount is the most likely solution.
L: And in terms of the price discount that is expected, how is that determined? Is it determined based on the value in the new indication as well as the volume , is it based on a weighted average price?
M: Yes. 
L:Based on the weighted average price of the previous price, as well as the standalone price in the new indication and the relative volume of the two indications, if after calculating it, the discount was only like, very small like 2% discount, because the value in the new indication is high and the volume is low. Do you think that a price discount of only like 2% as possible? 
M:I don't think that 2% discount. 2% is what I call price erosion.
L: what about net price?
M: Once again, it's combination of different factors. We discussed the size of the target population ,we discussed XXX, but we also have to discuss the time since the first product was launched within the first indication.  The idea is thinking about the return on investment which could have been made. I think that the price discount, the net price discount, once again, based on all the different factors we have been discussing. Maybe somewhere between 5 to 10% and sometimes even higher - under the assumption that the increase in the population is significant. If this is the not the case, then I think that we may have a price, price discount going only down to 5%, for example.
L: And when you were saying the increase in population is significant, what % increase are you considering to be significant-  a 10% increase in volume? Or like 20-30%? What do you what do you feel like is a significant increase in population?
M: I think that we will have to come to the absolute numbers because, you know, increasing 20 patient by 10% makes 2, increasing 2 millions population by 10% makes a much bigger increase or a much bigger impact on cost. So, I think that I can really, I cannot answer this question in terms of relative or absolute. So, honestly,  I think it's really difficult, but I think that if you're increasing the size of the target population by, let's say, more than 20%, then that will be significant. But of course, it depends on the absolute numbers.",DAI475
12,168.m,"So I guess my last question would just be - if you go to the very last slide 29. So, at a high level,  Product X could be available in four different indications. And there's different ways they could launch - so sequence 1 is they launch in one, then they launch in two at the same time, then they launch in the last one. Sequence 2 is they launch in three all together at once, followed by the fourth and then sequence 4 is they just launch in you know, one after the other after the other. My question to you is just : do you see any benefit in one of these sequences over the other, in terms of maintaining price or things like that?
M: Well, I think that in terms of maintaining price, I would suggest that sequence 2 is the best one. The question is, is that they will maintain a price but the starting point may be lower. That's, that's the point, because if you start with sequence 1 or 4, , they start with the same target population, So they will have a price for indication A and then the price discount will be different. And of course will depend on what is the benefit for each of the indication, because once again, the what will be driving the initial price will be the benefit in the indication which is going to be first assessed, and the size of the target population. So the suggestion is definitely to start with the indication in which they perceive that the benefit is the highest, because that's where they can get the higher price and then if they launched for example, if you compare sequence 1 to sequence 4 , theyâ€™ll start with the same price, my guess is that the price reduction of course, it depends on what is going to be the perceived benefit in indication HER2 gastric cancer or indication B,  but they will they will have a bigger price discount in sequence 1 than in sequence 4, because once again they come with a bigger population.
L: do you think it's possible if typically, based on the populations if they launched in sequence, it might be like a 10% discount for gastric, a 10% discount for indication B, but together do you think it would necessarily be 20? Or do you think they could get only a discount of like 15 or 18? 
M: exactly. I think that they can have they will not necessarily add the expected discount. So that can be as you mentioned, that can be 15 instead of 20.",DAI475

This can be a problem, not having the label. Itâ€™s usually a problem, but not for 3l.

Because they know that in 3l the evidence is very poor, and usually physicians give a range of drugs. What they donâ€™t do is to nominate an off-label drug. By officially nominating it, itâ€™s an official choice, itâ€™s like an official endorsement.

[Are you looking for QoL to be maintained, improved..?]
You always look for improvement. But in this case OS is good, so the question is, do you buy this additional lifetime with the patients being worse-off. This is where QoL becomes important. For my assessment of moderate, it would be sufficient if you maintain QoL. Even if it slightly goes down, you could consider it, but you would have to look very carefully into how much it goes down. 
[What about for the 2l population]

[What is your rationale?]
OS is good, 0.6, and now Iâ€™m really concerned with the QoL. Basically, are the patients worse off while being alive or not. I mean you have these drugs for which the QoL is going down and then you have the question of, are these extra monthsâ€™ worth it.",DAI475

Itâ€™s a good question, in particular as new things get out there. I would think Ramucirumab might be mentioned, because it went through the process, and also Keytruda â€“ I think it got Hint of added benefit in the latest decision. The comparator should be drugs which went through the process, so thereâ€™s an interlocking of drugs [26:15], so Keytruda is very likely to be named as the comparator. But again, they would name a range of comparators. 
[So Keytruda and also Ramucirumab. In terms of other similar agents, irinotecan, some of the taxanes, would those be lower if they didnâ€™t go through the GBA process?]
They would name a range of 2l, after platinum treatment. And then 2l, they would name a range of drugs and these should most likely be included. 
[So do you think that irinotecan or the taxanes would also be included in the comparator basket?]
It could be, yes, if theyâ€™re still the SOC, I think theyâ€™re still given, and I think they could be included. Also, a decision regarding to what extent the GBA wants to reflect the truth of what is done in Germany or what they would actually like to do with the system. 
[What do you mean?]
The GBA is making a decision about the SOC. They look at what is actually done in Germany, but they also look at the guidelines. And then they make a decision. And itâ€™s a medical unit, itâ€™s not a public decision [28:29]. And if there is strong belief that there is a drug which is given to 20-25% of the population, but that should be phased out anyway, and that will most likely be phased out in the next 2-3 years because the other drugs should take its place, then they might not nominate it as a comparator.

Second line. The GBA is following the label to the letter.
[So if itâ€™s for patients who have received a prior HER2 targeting treatment, you think itâ€™s going to be 2l, as opposed to 2l or later?]
If the EMA label is vague and saying it must have HER2 targeted prior and theyâ€™re not saying at which stage, in which line, then the GBA will split it up into 2l and 3l+. 
[Okay so if they donâ€™t specify the line, just say has received prior HER2 targeted treatment, then it could be 2l or 3l, because thereâ€™s some ambiguity as the prior treatment couldâ€™ve been in 2l, couldâ€™ve been in 1lâ€¦]

13,69,"(note: also see above ACT cell) [If Product X receives no added benefit in 2l, and a minor or major benefit in 3l, what are the price implications?]
Letâ€™s assume minor and no added benefit. Since this year thereâ€™s a new law which stipulates that if you have minor added benefit you must match the cost of the comparator. The implication is that you must match the price of the comparator therapy in each application area. 
[do you think that means matching the price of Keytruda or Cyramza?]
Yes. Not the price, but the annual therapy cost. 
[If the drug is only given for 7 months (during PFS) â€“ are you matching the cost for 7 months, or for 12 months?]
What the EMA label is saying. If EMA label says give until progression, then the assumption is that itâ€™s given throughout the whole year. If EMA is saying only give 5 cycles â€“ then the therapy cost is only 5 cycles. 
[What if the progression is less than 1 year]
Not being recognised, not important
[So unless the EMA label specifies no of cycle, the assumption is that the patients take it for a full year]
Yes.
[Cyramza and Keytruda have different costs. Keytruda is roughly 75k/yr. Cyramza is around 50k/yr. What price do you expect?]
The question is, what is the price for Keytruda? It seems a bit high. So, is this the list or net price?
[It should be the net price. The net prices are usually published so should be the net. Will double-check that]
I would think it should match the price of Cyramza, around 50K/year, if itâ€™s improvement against this drug. 
[So if it receives minor improvement, it must match the cost of the comparator. Do you think receiving a major benefit is a possibility, or is there only a low likelihood?]
It could be. It could be. Borderline. 0.6 is a good improvement. The question is now the QoL. It could get a major improvement, itâ€™s not completely unlikely. 
[What are the price implications?]
20-30% premium to the comparator. 
[Premium in this case to Cyramza? 20% premium would be like 60k]
Yes.
[How does it work. I know thereâ€™s diff pricing rules if it receives a no added benefit. If it receives no added benefit in 2l. But if it receives a minor or significant added benefit in 3l, what is the price, can they still just receive the price for the added benefit?]
There would be price negotiations, you look at the patient size, and you make a retail price.
[So the higher price for 3l would probs be for a smaller volume, and then there would be a price for 2l, with no added benefit. So if itâ€™s a no added benefit, my understanding is that it would be benchmarked against the cheapest comparator in the basket, correct?]
Itâ€™s not always the case, but basically thatâ€™s the idea, yes. 
[In that case what would you expect to be the price for 2l ref for no added benefit?]
I could see paclitaxel or irinotecan could be the comparator, but these seem to be very low prices. I could imagine that it would be in the ballpark, so 15k to 20k/year. 
[So you said the comparators are really cheap, can you explain the implication again?]
Not officially, but thereâ€™s an understanding that what the system really wants to avoid, which is considered next to a disaster, is if a drug is being withdrawn from the market. So thereâ€™s some leniency in pricing there. 
[So you mentioned a 15-20k price, so even a premium over the cheapest ones. Do you think you would have to go to an arbitration board to get that price?]
Good question. The path I could see here is arbitration, but then again if they realise theyâ€™re going to lose anyway, then they wonâ€™t go there. But most likely, if you have no added benefit you would most likely go to the arbitration board.
[In the arbitration board discussion, including some of these other products in the pricing discussion, like Cyramza, in addition to irinotecan and paclitaxel could maybe increase the price to around 15 -20k, just for 2l]

13,79.a,"[Slide 21. Trial C; 2l; this is the trial the EMA required for market authorisation, but this trial would be available after trial A and B. Any initial thoughts?]
Seems to be a proper trial design, so everything fine there. 
[If this trial becomes available after the initial assessment of Product X, how do you think it would impact the GBAâ€™s assessment. Would it be a re-assessment, orâ€¦?]
It depends. It depends on the initial submission. If you feel that the data you have is not perfect, but there will be better data coming down the road, you can get a conditional assessment with the condition to resubmit the evidence in due time. You can always ask for reassessments if you have new evidence. If you get an unconditional you can ask for reassessment. I donâ€™t feel like the assessment is going to change, because this will be most likely minor added benefit anyway. 0.7 OS and I donâ€™t see that will bring it to major added benefit. 
[First when you were saying they could get a conditional assessment. This is for the 2l population, the population which received no added benefit. If the manufacturer said, we have this trial coming, how would the conditional assessment work]
In this case you would get no added benefit, but you can say you want to resubmit in 3 yearsâ€™ time. I donâ€™t think they would get a conditional added benefit for the trial B. 
[Why?]
Because itâ€™s too bad. Thereâ€™s no reason to believe it could be good. 
[If the manufacturer knew trial C was coming which provides additional evidence for 2L, do you think they could get conditional added benefit for trial B, given this additional trial is coming?]
I donâ€™t think so. Because I think conditional is usually if the bias is high, but for a single arm trial, you would not get that. 
[So there wouldnâ€™t be a conditional added benefit, however when the data was available they would resubmit, and based on that they could get a minor added benefit]
Yes.

I donâ€™t think so.",DAI475
13,81.b,"[So when they ask for reassessment, assume they get a minor added benefit, implications on price?]
That depends on the negotiations. You have weighted price, and the question I show the 3l weighs into the price negotiations. Most likely you can now ask for minor added benefit vs the actual comparator, so I guess that should improve the price. 
[So you can ask for minor added benefit against Cyramzaâ€¦ I guess in the trial the comparator is Cyramza so I guess thatâ€™s the strongest reference?]
Yes. Likely, yes. But itâ€™s not the price thatâ€™s going to be matched, the therapy costs are going to be matched. 
[So now under the assumption that thereâ€™s a new price for minor added benefit, so a new weighted price across indications, do you think the price could increase from the original price given the new weighted price?]
Yes.",DAI475
13,82.c,"[So it possible for the price to increase after the original price?]
Yes. Yes. To be clear, itâ€™s not the price as such, because the list price is set, you negotiate about the discount.  If a pharmaceutical company comes to the market with a list price, an official price, then the list price never changes. Only changes if the company wants it to. But what you actually discuss is the discount they have to give to the system.

When you look at the hazard ratio, thatâ€™s basically the idea, but whatâ€™s really good is a hazard ratio of 0.5 or less, because thatâ€™s when you go into considerable benefit, but then again if this only means 1 month more, then it will be discounted. 
[So, if it said 12m, so a 1.2 month improvement vs comparator]
It would be minor. They would look at QoL data, and you really need to maintain the QoL and have the same level of adverse events.

Iâ€™m pretty sure it will be in the next update. Because theyâ€™re now saying it should be done, but you have a problem in the German system, that these tests are not always being reimbursed.

That is fully in line with my understanding. --- [scope for more targeted treatments?] To be honest we don't mind for being targeted if we are assessing a treatment, we care if it brings additional benefit on top of the current standard of care. Anf if you can improve overall survival with Aspirin  in these patients we would pay 10,000s of EUR for Aspirin. So targeted is medically nice and with my pharmacist hat on interesting but with my payers hat on I don't mind for targeted drugs.",DAI475

14,10,"Yeah I think I am aware of the product, and of the body of evidence for that product and to make it short: no chance for additional benefit in aGC in DE. Because in 3L we do have Lonsurf as SoC because Lonsurf has, this was not a comparator here in trial a, to my understanding, trifluridine-tipiracil. Lonsurf has ended the DE added benefit assessment with an additional benefit and whenever a drug exists in DE which has an AB GBA is legally required to define this drug as adequate comparator for the next one which is coming. [repeat please] Lonsurf ended up with an additional benefit in 3L GC in DE, the assessment of Lonsurf had the result added benefit and currently the guidelines says yes it is Lonsurf or taxane irinotecan but GBA will likely say it is Lonsurf only as we have already assessed that Lonsurf is better than taxane irinotecan and it is now SoC. So we will ask the question for the next one - are you better than the current SoC which is Lonsurf so it is very dependent on the definition of the adequate comparator of the GBA whether the manufacturer has a chance to get the study accepted. And if it should come in that scenario I made Lonsurf only adequate comparator then the assessment would stop formally at the very early because GBA would ask comparison against what okay not Lonsurf, that is our SoC, stop of assessment due to wrong comparison and no one would have a look to endpoints or something like that. This would be a formal stop due to wrong comparator. [legal, what is driving this?] The social code book in Germany. the Social code book requires that the GBA comapares against the so called SoC and then there is some room for itnerpretation of what is SoC at a certain time point. The law says also that if there is an already positively assessed drug in the same indication this should be preferably SoC. So there is some room for the GBA to deviate but to give you the most drastic example I have seen was 10 years ago BRAF V600 inhibitors (?) in metastatic melanoma, i think dabrafenib and vemurafenib. The first one was vemurafenib tested against the old DTIC, huge effect size, huge AB. and the second BRAF V600 inibitor dabrafenib came 4 mo after but anyone said at that timepoint it is a mistake  to still treat with this old damn DTIC, we now have vemurafenib and the dabrafenib comparator changed within 4 mo.they also had their study against the old thing.",DAI475
14,11.b,"[you are telling me irino pac won't be accepted?] correct. [keytrud included irino pac as comparators based on publication and offlabel use, could support in 3L ?] not really because we would need real world, I think the only thing which can support it would be real world data that this pacli and irinotecan is used to comparably high extent in reality. The label is holy in DE, first it is label and guideliens and only if there is hard evidence that label and guidelines do not reflect the reality then there is some room for discussion to get other things granted. [if group of experts say can be used off label] no it would not be enough, the group of experts would say it can be used off label and the reality has to show that it is used off label despite esiting labelled alternatives. And then we would have to understand the reason for using an offlabel drug despite labelled alternatives existing. And only if there is a good medical rationale to still go for off label instead of the two labelled alternatives there would be some room and the chance to be hnest is low and that was the reason for my hard judgement of no chance.",DAI475
14,11.c,"there will be no decision on that because the assessment will stop earlier than that due to that formal reason, so you won't get an answer to that question. But in general we have no problem with an Asian population as long as there is no evidence or clinical rationale that race is an effect mediator and for an antibody-drug conjugate that is unlikely. For other things like enzymes this could be different but I would not see an issue here. [would the gba look into?] No GBA won't look into this stuyd, the flow chart stops earlier. [if they do] If they do they cannot look here if it is only Asian population you cannot calculate effect modifications between races. if only Asians are recruited here then the question is is there any medical rationale or any publications that HER2-directed therapy works different in Asians than in Caucasians and if not then everything would be okay.",DAI475
14,30,"And the next thing is that this will be the third indication for the drug we are talking about so they are already on the market, they have an AB at least if I anticipate the right drug they have a AB in 2L BC and as the price that is negotiated at the end is always a blended price of the different indications, label spans and the different value of these indications and there is no will in the GBA if the drug already has already at least one indication with AB to build really small bridges to get the AB in the next indication. they will say if we do get a next indication with no AB then we have better arguments to push the price a bit down and in the next negotiation the price will anyway remain high as a big indication already has formal AB. [no AB?] yes [in 3L+] yes in 3L+ but same in 2L again formal reason it is a single arm study and the GBA says we need comparative evidence comapred to the standard of care we have 3 labelled options in 2L  with a one arm study no chance to get an AB.  ----- [if irino and pacli accepted by GBA what is the accepted comparator what would be the additional AB?] Best case minor AB to be honest because overall response ration is ignored, PFS is ignored as it not relevant to the patient, OS is relevant to the patient for sure with those 4 mo more but at a higher rate of G3 AEs and no QoL so the GBA would say it is nice that the patient lives 4 mo longer but if he has to pay for these 4 months with such a huge rate of AEs it becomes problematic. Normally 4 mo more would be eligible for a considerable AB but this will grade it down to minor as long as you have no QoL to mitigate this. [say they have QoL would that help move the needle?] Yes that would help move the needle maybe back to considerable. Because you need something to mitigate this accusation 4 months more but worse QoL and if you can show QoL remains stable despite or in stable QoL you get 4 mo then that is for sure a argument. [only if accept comparator?] yes otherwise they would not get to that point.",DAI475
14,30.a,[once ema approval they have to submit both trails?] yes correct. If it is only an expansion of an existing SMPC they have to submit both because the DE patient can claim for a drug that is on the market and we cannot say that the drug is reimbursed for BC but it is not reimbursed for GC if the SMPC says we are labelled for both.,DAI475
14,33,"As 2L label or 2L+. 2L and 3L, from 2L onwards will be the interpretation so you have a mix and both trials would be in one basket.",DAI475
14,34.c,"[early access data from europe would it be accepted?] no it would not because the GBA says if a certain question can be answered in a H2H RCT then it has to be answered in that study otherwise it is the manufacturer's problem. And only if the GBA is convinced by an imperative reason why you will never get an answer in an RCT to that question he is willing to use real world evidence, indirect comparisons and all that stuff. And to be honest I do not see that imperative reason why an RCT should not be possible, it was even done here just unfortunately with the wrong comparator. [so stuck on comparator and RCt here?] yes",DAI475
14,34.d,"[ITC not going to change anything?] it helps because the underlying question is always a sense of underlying comparative effectiveness. Whether they accept it formally yes or no the chance is not that high but I always advice if there is a chance and an appropriate bridging comparator is available do that indirect comparison even if the GBA does not accept it the physicians will ask for it, they also have the question give us a sense of effectiveness versus the currently used options and you will get at least a brownie point at GBA if it is not formally accepted. [help with AB?] the likelihood is 20%, it is relatively rarebut not impossible.",DAI475
14,36,"No it will not help as we are talking only about 10% additional popultion size of an existing drug. The will to go into risk sharing agreements is generally low in DE and if we do so we do it for one time gene therapies or something liek that, addressing uncertainties around duration of effect and all such stuff but for such a chronic therapy if it does no longer work the therapy the stopped and that is it. Why should we go into risk sharing especially if there are labelled alternatives, the overhead is too much for too less results. no chance.",DAI475
14,69,"[if no AB it would be price benched against the cheapest agent in the ACT? Which one?] This would be taxane and irinotecan for 2L and also for 3L. Maybe in 3L you could have luck, I am not sure whether there is an explicit label for taxane and irinotecan in 3L. In 2L we do have an explicit label so for second line it is for sure that. 3L could also be Lonsurf if taxane is not labelled there officially. then it is a blended piece of value at the end, for the price it is not detrimental because the BC indication is so much bigger so if you add an additional 10% eligible target population at a lower value the maximum risk to the price is that 10%, likely lower.  ---- [so no AB price benchmark would be the basket of drug in 2L and 3L?] correct [if have an AB what price could negotiate?] it is a small patient population, Lonsurf is at about 50k 60k EUR per year. [lonsurf 3k per month] that is cheaper than i thought, Cyramza is at 50k EUR, i think 50k EUR would be possible in case of AB [on the basis of what?] on the basis on an overall survival improvment. [net per year] correct but net and list is quite the same in DE. [price per year assuming recieve for 12 mo or course less long] we standartise to 1 year and usually especially with your data you have provided with 12.5 mo OS i think it would be the base case hypothesis they are treating at about 1 year but we do have examples where it is fully clear that it is only half a year where the patient is treated nevertheless concept in mind for the pricing negotiations is yearly therapy cost and if they concentrate in half a year the individual tablet can be more expensive. It is standardised to one year a gene therapy which lasts one year would have the full cost at day one and not only the 365 part of it. [if used for 6 mo and 50k EUR mon?] it can cost 65k EUR in those 6 months.  Then we would need good data that the ussual treatment duration is 6 months because if the ususal treatment duration is 1 yr we won't pay 100k. If you want to get the same yearly amount in a usual shorter time frame you need a good story and good data that in the vast majority of cases the timeframe is shorter.   -------------- [and if they have an AB in 3L but not in 2L impact on price discussion?]  In both cases not as much as I already mentioned at least in this example as we are talking on maybe 10% additional patient vs whatever 3% additional patient on top of the BC indication so price wise it doesn't make a real difference. [50k as potential if AB, if no AB?] If there is no AB I think for 2L they would pay the weighted average prie out of this current basket, ramucirumab, taxanes, irinotecan, plus a very small pembro share, real world data important to get a sense where this weighted average is, and for 3L if you have a bit of luck and Lonsurf is the only one which is defined as the adequate comparator then parity to Lonsurf. At the end we are maybe 30k EUR. [bit cheaper than Lonsurf?] If Londurf is the only adequate comparator in 3L the value would be the Lonsurf value with no AB because DE reimburses the drug at parity to SoC. Okay since 2 months we have a new law that says if a drug has no AB but its comparator is patented it cannot be more expensive than 10% less than the patented comparator so they would pay 29 instead of 32 in 3L but the ballpark remains the same.",DAI475
14,71,"[if have AB should informal comparators be leveraged in pricing negotiations?] if there is an AB there is no informal comparator because in case of AB the rocket science is to put a price tag on that extent of AB. Formal comparators exists only with no AB because the law says [informal with FAM?] Informal I think is Cyramza and Lonsurf, relatively new options in 2L and 3L  [so they would have to bring the into the negotiations?] with AB in the negotiations you have three the negotiations is very different in terms of the starting point AB or no AB. if no Ab in the negotiation the only topic of the negotiation is what is the distribution of the current comparators, real world patient shares, real world prices and to find a compromise that at the end the GBA can say that you are not more expensive than the current SoC. If you have an AB the influencing factor is the extent of the AB, the price of the drug which is negotiated in other European markets, sometimes does not exist if DE is the first launch country and the price of sp called comparable drugs. And what comparable is is again negotiated, it is not the medical adequate comparator stated by the GBA for the first step of the benefit assessment. Comparable drug is then a much broader term and I think you can try to bring in all those drugs on that s;lide here but it is a negotiation, there is no formal algorithm or formal triggers to accept one drug as comparable and the other not, you need a good story, good soft skills, negotiate.   [if they want to e.g. bring in keytruda what is their best argment from your experience?] I think it is impossible as it is a clear 1L drug oh it is labelled in 2L for MSIhigh. Maybe to a very small extent they can bring it in with real world arguments on distribution of those MSIhigh patients on all keytruda patients. they will never agree to say that Keytrda is fullu comparable if only a very small share is treated in that line of therapy. becuase line of therapy is still an important question here as label remains holy even for the negotiations here.",DAI475

The trial is good, the comparator is correct. OS is primary endpoint with 5.5mo is also fine but you do not get a credit le's say preliminary AB hoping such a trial will be positive. It will start you get no AB and then you can come back and turn it inot AB if the data is mature. [when do they need to give you that data?] they are okay forever to be honest because they are totally relaxed as the result in the first step will be no AB and the manufacturer has the interest to turn this into AB and if he does not the price will not increase. [can the price increase?] yes we do have out of 300 negotiated AMNOG drugs maybe 20 examples with an increase in price whilst increasing the benefit assessment but tbh not in oncology as the prices are even quite high from the beginning. but in diabetes and so we do see these examples. best example I think was SGLT2, Jardiance had no AB in the first step, it was abotu 1 euro a day but after the CKD study and the endpoint studies with met(?not clear33:30) reduction they nearly doubled their price. [any other examples?] I think those examples were in diabetes. Farxiga made the same move I think but I don't have a full list of examples [xtandi?] could also be [why not in oncology?] As the prices are much higher from the beginning let's say and the will is lower to even increase those prices. Usually you can come back to your price prior to the GC expansion let's say if you lose 5% of your price whilst expanding to GC and you come back with an AB in GC you can get those 5% back but you won't get above your initial price. [what cna they do to get increasee?] no they cannot not as they had a very brave starting price point in BC which is much above all the price points which we have already talked on here. [you think good price in BC?] they ahve already launched in BC with a quite huge price to my understanding which is twice as high as the prices here in GC and as we do not have indication prices we do have indication specific value but at the end of the day we have to blend it to put a price tag on a vial and so if they expand into GC they are anyways the most expensive drug in GC even without any AB and so the will is very limited to further increase the price. [ so very expensive drug in GC will price be negotiated down?] No I think they would acept it at the end but as long as this study has not finished the individual sickness funds would inform the physicians that there is no additional benefit proven but it is much mroe expensive so please prescribe the other alternatives.

Even in 2l we do still have immunooncology agents if not used already in 1L so we are just talking on the no genetic alterations here and I think looks good but in DE I think theroay patients with contraindications to IO are quite rare and in the vast majority the patients get a combinaton fo ChT and PDL1 as it is fully reimbursed no issues for access in DE. The left side and the middle are fully okay and the right side is a handful of patients in the whole country I would say.

[not knew this] if not giveen in the 1l. if you came out of the 1L with ChT pembro for exmaple then after progress you can switch to ipinivo. in 2L+ [her2 not sure what they get] currently it is even not measured whether they are HER2 positive or not and they get the normal NSCLC treatment in 2L so the treatments you have listed on the slide before are currently also given to the HER2 patients.

Talking on the non-mutaed guys for sure absence of any driver, PDL1 expression doesn't really matter I think am not aware of all the individual benefit outcomes for the 2L options here in the upper right corner, base case hypothesis if GBA says if the guidelines say there is nothing which is systematically prefered over another in this bucket of 5 or 6 drugs then it is physician's choice out of those 5 or you can choose distinctly one of these drugs. GBA has two ways to define its adequate medial comparator as part of the medical benefit assessment. it can say it is PDL1 or or ChT or ramucirumab or nintedanib. So if he makes that or conjunction between the drugs then the manufacturer can choose one and make a distinct trial against that one but you will get this or conjunction only if every clinical and every guideline says it doesn't really matter whichdrug we can use all of them are equieffective. If clinicans say oh it depends on the previous LOT or with that patient characteristic I use x and with this patient characteristic I use y then GBA says physician's choice dependent on pretreatment on pretreatment and your study protocol would have to reflect that physician's choice.",DAI475

14,149,"[basket of 5 drugs?] Yes it is that basket, he PDL1 is undoubtably in that basket now. [good for manufacturer] yes it is not for sure. It is cheaper than the current price in BC but still a high price. And it is higher than in GC. [should they launch GC or NSCLC first] doesn't matter to my best guess as we are talking on 400 patients in one population and another 300 in the second it makes no sense to make that effort. The best case is to launch both together, writing one dossier and making one pricing negotiation because the differences are so small, a dossier is at half a million and the pricing negotiation needs half a year from the workload perspective I would launch both together. [size so small no big difference?] yes the price decrease by launching these two indication it will be about 5-10% of the BC price and whether it is 6 or 6.5 or 5.5 the uncertainty due to the negotiation is much bigger than the uncertainty due to different price comparator baskets in those two indications. [isolated launch price potential?] If it would be completely isolated I would launch NSCLC first because it is always easier to negotiate a bit down than to negotiate up and the isolated price potential in NSCLC is higher than the isolated price potential in GC.

If it is pembro plus ChT. single use is meaningless of these drugs, if you are talking about pembro plus chemo regimen and the other things are only included in this ChT side of PDL1 plus chemo regimen then it would be okay and it would fit into the second box here and if this is meant then this would be okay for sure still a risk but i dont think that high that the GBA will require PDL1 mono for the pdl1 high patients and pdl1 plus chemo for the pdl1 patients as common sense in the gba is if you can get rid of chemo because you are a high expresser of PDL you should do so. You get the same results at less costs and less side effects. Best case would be to differentiate bewteen pdlhigh and pdl low.

I didnâ€™t find any numbers on HER2+ in the population because you need for this epidemiological studies and we do not have such things so far, but these numbers you presented in slide 5, there are about 700 patients, all together were HER+ in 2L and we have in Germany we have about 3000 patients for 1L therapy. So, I think your numbers are fitting if you consider 3000 1L therapy patients. I can give you also the epidemiological data I found, we have in men we have 28 patients per 100,000 in Germany and 20 patients with gastric cancer in 100,000 for women. And the average age at the time of diagnosis in women is 72 and in men itâ€™s 75.",DAI475

If you ask payers and HTA experts, solid tumor oncology is always high burden and you have in the 2L therapy, you have some, there is no unmet need, there is limited or lower unmet need because you have different options in 2L therapy. However, in the 3L therapy, you have a very limited, lets say, range of treatments. You already indicated on Slide 6 Trifluridin for example, which is regarded as the therapy of choice by the German GBA as a 3L therapy. So, I think in the 2L therapy, you have therapeutic options, but if you go to advanced cancer, in the 3L therapy, the therapeutic field is quite empty.",DAI475

The German oncologist in gastric cancers try to follow the guidelines so this is the way, the GBA and the payers, if they are looking for comparators. They are always looking at the guideline recommendations because this is what counts. 
[When it comes to these guidelines and this SoC what roles does the EMA play in these recommendations. Like for example a product, like, Irinotecan, might not have an EMA label indication specifically for gastric cancer. ]
German is very clear in this. If you have products on the market and they are off label, they are not regarded as, they are out of the game. The GBA would never lets say, take a comparator which is an off-label drug. So, the only drugs the GBA is considering are drugs which have an EMA label in this specific indication where the decision on reimbursement is made. ",DAI475

15,10,"We speak about Trial A or B?
[Trial A]
Ok, trial population is the 3L therapy, which patients with unresectable, metastatic gastric cancer. Which is fine because as I mentioned there is very few therapeutic options in this patients subgroup. What is good is that it is a randomized, controlled trial with 200 patients. There is a remark Asian population which I do not understand. This trial will only be in Asia or what does it mean?
[Yes, so the population is only in Japan and Korea. ]
So, this might be a problem, because the GBA would like to see at least European or German data. Because you know, Asian population we have a higher incidence of gastric cancer in comparison to Germany and Europe and the US. In these countries gastric cancer is decreasing rapidly. In China, Japan and India very high rates. So this might be a problem that the study population could not be accepted as representative of the German population. So this might be a problem for your client. Ok, so inclusion criteria is ok. Progress on 2 prior regiments, this is very much in line with the last GBA file on Pembro in gastric cancer they also had 2 groups as the indication, the definition of the subpatient group was people with advanced gastric cancer with 1 prior therapy and the other group was Asians with advanced cancer with at least 2 prior therapies. So this is very much in the line of the GBA. The problem is the comparator you have here physicians choice which is in principle ok. You have very often physician choice, you have irinotecan and paclitaxel, as a letâ€™s say as a description and this is not in line with what the GBA is asking because in October of last year he stated in advanced gastric cancer Trifluridine-tipiracil should be the comparator in this group of patients which have at least 2 prior therapies. So, the physicians choice was allowed by the GBA in the group of patients which have at least 1 prior therapy, but in the other group with at least 2 prior therapies before, it was not as physicians choice but very clearly Trifluridine-tipiracil. Irinotecan and paclitaxel in this context are out of, lets say, the scope of the GBA and will not be accepted I think. Is this clear for you?
[Yes, thatâ€™s clear. The GBA stated in October that Trifluridine is the standard of care, should be the compactor in the 3L population, what document are you referring to? ]
Itâ€™s the IQWIG dossier from 26 of October on page 43, where the GBA comparator is described.",DAI475
15,10.a,"[Does the GBA have any thoughts on the Phase II trial versus the Phase III trial? ]
I mean Phase II trials, you know we have this rapid in Europe, these rapid procedures, we have it in often diseases that are based on Phase II trials, drugs are launched and are within the system and through the FDA and the EMA. So this is nothing that is absolutely unknown to the GBA. Because the GBA is conservative they like to have Phase III trials of course. Your client could use the argument that in this therapeutic field in 2L therapy there is very limited option of treatments and if you have good clinical data with comparison w physicians choice or with Trifluridine then you could take this argument of few therapeutics that Phase II is ok.",DAI475

15,11.d,"[Which end point PFS, you primary focus on the overall survival outcome? ]
Yes, in oncology overall response rate is not really well accepted. So these both endpoints are not really good ones in oncology. So overall survival is the key, lets say, endpoint as the best by the GBA and this is what makes it good which is important for the price decision and negotiations.
[Is it acceptable that overall survival is a key secondary endpoint? Is that acceptable or does it need to be primary? ]
No, itâ€™s ok if its secondary as well. ",DAI475
15,12,"I can make my answer very short, I can scratch it and wrote there not acceptable because itâ€™s a single arm study with no comparator. If you want to have a premium price, you should not go with a single arm to the GBA. We expect in Germany if you want to have a good price, a comparison with the therapeutic standard. This is not given in this Trial B case, so it has no chance to be successful. ",DAI475

The patient population would also be with 2 prior regiment or with 1 prior regimen?
[Just one prior regiment. ]
This is easy because in Trial be if inclusion criteria is one prior, we can look at the GBA decision on pembro there is the physicians choice. So this makes things easier for your client because hey have chosen pembro in this 1 prior regiment physicians choice and this was said and this made things for your client easier.",DAI475
15,13,"[What are your thoughts on the safety? was more asked for trial a]
I mean safety is a big topic in Germany in general. You have this concept of benefit and harm so you can have a product which has no clinical benefit for the patient or only a low benefit but it has less harm than the comparator then its also regarded as a benefit, in this context. So it is a benefit harm ratio. I think in this patient population we are talking about with 3L therapy unresectable and metastatic gastric, I mean these people have the hell already so I think that these things are not really in the main focus. Because they are already altered by therapies and have problems they are at the final stage of diseases so this is not really considering the general condition of these patients, letâ€™s say pneumonia and other things they play a role but in these patients with a low life expectation and low biological condition anyway they would get some problems.",DAI475
15,14.a,"Yes of course, they will ask why you canâ€™t use Trial A, why its supportive only. You have to explain this, you know. 
[They will ask the manufacturer why EMA designated it as supportive? ]
No, not speaking about EMA; but if you want to have a specific price, the price is set up on a specific trial. You have to provide this trial to the GBA and in this case it would be Trial B and they are looking, because then the GBA is making the decision on Trial B and because it is single arm, I mean, this will be the decision base. ",DAI475
15,16.e,"What is the duration of the study of Trial A? 
[Iâ€™m not totally sure actually. ]
It should be lets say more than 6 months at least, because everything below 6 months makes problem to GBA especially in chronic disease and oncology. So your client should have one over 2 months study. This is necessary to be able to be regarded as reliable and QoL data are important, and yeah.
[What if the QoL data is collected from Trial A, does it matter that its an open label trial? ]
No, I think this is ok. But you should have, I mean in gastric cancer field, there are several QoL, it should be a disease specific QoL measures. This would be good.",DAI475
15,30,"[Trial A benefit rating? ]
I am only discussing medium overall survival he other endpoints I thin they are not really helpful. They are 12 months in comparison to 8.5 months. I would say that it would be in the worst case 3 moderate or even significant therapeutic improvement so either 3 or 4 because we are speaking about a 3L therapy in patients which already underwent 2 or 1 prior regiment. So there itâ€™s a hopeless situation if you really have an increase in mOS this is really something which is helpful to patients. SI think minimum would be 3 or even more significant improvement. [In terms of GBAs assessment in their benefit rating, do you think given the comparator is Irinotecan/paclitaxel, is there a potential for an added benefit or is it an automatic no added benefit? ]
I think it would be not defined, so if the comparator is not in line with the GBA decision and they are clearly in favor of trifluridine then it would be no or its not quantifiable.  --- [So, no added benefit given the comparator for Trial A. In trial B given the single arm you would also expect no added benefit?]
Yes, or not quantifiable.
[Why would it receive no quantifiable vs no added benefit? Why would it receive one vs the other? ]
Because in the Trial A you have the wrong comparator and in Trial B you have nothing. Its not even a placebo control study. So you have in orphan disease, in the worst case you have a placebo control or standard of care as a comparator but in trial B you are completely blank.",DAI475
15,30.a,"[If the EMA label is for 2L+, cant the manufacturer submit both trials to the GBA? ]
No, it has to be on the, we are speaking about one indication but different , letâ€™s say, itâ€™s the same indication put different positioning. First Trial A is positioned on 3L therapy and Trial B is positioned as 2L therapy. These are different aspects because if you send Trial B to the GBA 2L therapy you will get a different spectrum of comparators. The comparators in both trials are completely different, because 2L therapy has completely different therapy spectrum and 3L as we discussed also has different spectrum. There is only one drug which is regarded as the real comparator for 3L but if you go to 2L you have a much bigger options and then they would ask for head to head trials for example.",DAI475

[Yes, thatâ€™s correct. ]
Right, so it has no chance to be accepted even if you have other data basis. If this drug is not labelled for this, then it has no chance.

15,33,"[If the EMA label for product X is for advanced gastric patients HER2+ patients, who have received a prior HER2 targeting treatment, how do you think GBA would interpret that? ]
They do not interpret they are just following the EMA label, if they say the indication is 3L therapy for HER2+ and unresectable metastatic gastric, so they do not interpret, they take it and they have to accept it and they are looking for the proper comparator for this ema labelling. 
[If the EMA label says itâ€™s for patients that have received a prior HER2 treatment, do you think the GBA will interpret this as only 2L or 2L+?]
They do not specify in the Pembro decision. They only say after 1 prior therapy and you have to be in the advanced stage and thatâ€™s it. So they do not specify this because if they say our comparator is physicians choice they have to take into account there are other therapies, they canâ€™t limit the use of therapies.",DAI475
15,34.c,"[Would the French real world data address any concerns for the Asian population? ]
I donâ€™t know, it depends we have cancer registries here in Germany, they are collecting epidemiological data. Probably you would need specific data very deep info on HER2+, I am not a gastroenterologist, Iâ€™m an HTA and payer, so I have no insight on the clinical details. I think there might be some data basis in oncology in Germany or you could use Austria or Netherlands for it. It should be something from middle Europe, it might help to compare these outcome data on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life to your Asian population to show that lets say, starting age and cause of disease and prognosis are somewhat similar, this might help. Yes, this would be a good approach. I mean what your client could do is that, he could seek what we call early scientific advice, so to go to the GBA as soon as possible, because they have waiting time of 6 months and to ask the GBA, we are planning such and such studies in Asia in gastric cancer, is this ok for you and what additional data you would need to make up a positive decision for us. This new client could clarify this in a scientific advice talk with the GBA representatives.
[Would any of the French data be considered by the GBA? ]
I donâ€™t know difficult to say, better your client should ask. Your primary is ORR and secondary endpoint is overall survival, its ok. As I already told you efficacy the physicians choice, this is will be not accepted, so this is a problem. Progression free survival is something seen very critically by the GBA, this is not really regarded as a hard patient relevant outcome.",DAI475
15,34.d,"[Are indirect treatment comparisons considered by the GBA? ]
Itâ€™s a good question, in principle, the GBA and equick are accepting indirect frequent comparisons. They have in the method chapter for this, the requirements are so high that in the last 10 years, no one was successful. Donâ€™t do this its waste of time and money, because the hurdles and methodological expectations from the GBA, with the Asian population, this would not work. All companies who tried to this with indirect comparisons, they were not successful.",DAI475
15,35,"No, they only want to have clinical data, and the comparison with the clinical standard to see whether product X has a clear, whether thereâ€™s evidence for a clinical benefit or not. So whether it is in guideline or not, the clinical study is the key aspect, not the guideline itself. ",DAI475
15,36,"I donâ€™t think so because I mean I think it will get an orphan disease designation, I guess. Is this what yor client is looking for?
[Yes, exploring the likelihood. ]
Yes, so the number of patients we already discussed is about 200 or maybe 300 so this is not really a big budget topic and I do not think that this will play such a bug role that they have special conditions or so. What could be is that this is a new strategy of the FBA that they ask, especially if you have phase II trials, they will say we give you a conditional reimbursement for 1 year to this and this price and after one year your client has to provide phase III data and or additional data from registries/real world data from the usage in clinical practice. So especially in the field of orphan disease in Germany we have increasing numbers of requirements/request by the GBA on companies to provide additional data from daily use and therefore the companies have to set up registries, especially for patients numbers that are quite low and the clinical studies are quite small. 
[Does that need to be German data? ]
Yes, definitely.  
[The conditional reimbursement up registry data, thatâ€™s not enough to support additional benefit? ]
They donâ€™t do this in every case, if you have a phase III trial they say this is ok If you have a phase II trial, for example, then you get more requirements from this side of the GBA.",DAI475
15,69,"So, this is very easy in Germany. If your label is 3L therapy and you have no added benefit there would be the GBA say no added value or not quantifiable, then in the negotiations with the umbrella organizations of the health insurances, they take the price of these drugs, the avg price of the drugs, which are in the 3L therapy, trifluridine. This will be a mix price of the therapies in this 3L field and thatâ€™s it. So, it will make your client very unhappy.
[Would it be a parity price to Lonsurf or trifluridine? ]
It will not be a parity price. This is very often a mixed price. They look at the different prices of chemo, im not os in detail with the chemotherapies in 3L. They build up a virtual therapies based on this this will be the reference price of Product X. 
[From the guidelines, it seems, we discussed the taaxane and irinotecan, those are both off-label. If Lonsurf is the only comparator in the basket, do they expect a discount? ]
They will not consider the off-label drugs, clearly not because this is clearly said in the law. And the 3L therapy they will consider the price of Trifluridine-tipiracil, this is my expectation.
[If product X receives no added benefit, can it get the space prices as trifluridine? ]
Yes, in this range. There are some changes in the AMNOG process. That if you have a new product but this is not the case in Trial A, if you have a product which is in combination with already other established products, then you have a price offset of 20%. But, Product X will be single, it will not be combined, right, in the study with other chemotherapeutics?
[Yes]
But Trifluridine-tipiracil price range would be something the GBA would take into account. 
[When the GBA is thinking about price, what metric do they use? Price per course of therapy, price per month? ]
Price per patient per year. Jahrestherapiekosten is what it is called. This is what they are looking for. 
[So that would be around 30,000 Euro per year for Lonsurf, essentially. ]
If you say, I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m not aware about the (prices).
[So letâ€™s look at the 2L population for Trial B. So we were also expecting a no added benefit in the 2L population. What do you think are the price considerations there for that basket of comparators and the price reference? ]
I donâ€™t know because the, lets say, therapeutic range in 2L is much bigger and they will look on these therapeutic strategies, they will look at the 1st 3 frequent therapeutic prescription, the 3 highest prescriptions in 2L in gastric cancer and then they will make some price of it. This is a matter of debate.
[Is it a weighted average, price/volume? ]
Yes, itâ€™s a weighted average.
[So the price of product X, would that be parity to the weighted average or a little lower? ]
Yes, probably yes. 
[Are there ever any informal comparators that can be leveraged in price negotiations? Like a product in the appropriate therapy basket, like in 2L, there are some cheaper drugs like taxane or more expensive product like Pembro? ]
They will look at the prescription rate. If you have 6 therapeutic options according to the guidelines, the GBA will to take all 6, they will look at the prescription rates if the 1st 3 they have the numbers and they see from these 6, the first 3 most frequent drugs, they will take these because they are covering 60% of all patients in this 2L therapy and then they will take these drugs as the reference, but not all 6 because if the 5th/6th has very low prescription numbers itâ€™s not representative.",DAI475

Itâ€™s a phase III trial which is a very good, controlled, international population, so itâ€™s highly representative. Much more better than to have only Asians, because of the problems we discussed already, much more representative. And what is not clear to me, so its 2L okay, and then there are these patients, they already have 1 prior or 2 prior things. Is this defiant?
[Lets say itâ€™s just 1 prior. ]
Okay, so this would also be in line with the GBA. You have a comparator, are I think in the 2L therapy according to the guidelines. So they are also labeled for this as far as I know. So GBA will surely take these as the comparator I think because they are in line with the guidelines and the labelling. You have as a primary endpoint you have OS which is very important, so plus 5 versus 10 is also better outcome so I would rate that this would be regarded as letâ€™s say significant therapeutic improvement. Because, your comparator and labelling is ok.  [Letâ€™s say this data comes out after Trial A and B are initially assessed. Would the data need to be resubmitted to trigger a reassessment by the GBA? ]
Yes, because you have a completely, this would be a specific own HTA process. Because you have a completely different comparator and you have, I mean, other population. SO this is a thing of its own. This Trial C is really a good trial, if you look on tis, this trial has the highest, lets say, change to get a premium price because all the parameters are in line with the GBA thinking and decision making. Its phase III, its accepted comparator, primary endpoint is ok.

15,80.b,"So, as I already said, I think that in the previous trials, Trial A, your client would get a conditional reimbursement, limited to a specific time.

This would be a lets say, new AMNOG process on the drug.
[So it would get a conditional approval, for Trial A, a 3L population. But the new data is 2L. ]
You are right, so I mean anyway they will ask for Trial A for additional phase III data. So this will come anyway and if your Trial C comes on the market, its completely regarded as a new indication because its focusing on 2L therapy. GBA is looking at these things, they differentiate very strong according to the EMA label. So this is 3L then they want to see later data thatâ€™s 3L. So this is the differentiator. 
[What does the time point for the additional data in Germany look like? ]
Up to 2 years. I mean if itâ€™s a rare disease, they are more liberal in the decision because they know itâ€™s not easy to get patients. Gastric cancer is not as orphan as other chronic diseases so, in this case, they will probably be more generous and give the company more time. Lets say 2 years is expected.

This is difficult, a little bit difficult. So, if you look on the price, I mean, your comparator is ramucirumab and paclitaxel lets say they have an average price per year per patient about 50-60,000. And you are better in this case, so you could ask for a higher price I think I would expect. So, I would say that if the comparator is 50-55,000, you could ask for 60-75,000. But this depends a little bit also on the safety issues and things like that, so the devil is in the details. They can say ok, the neutropenia is too high, therefore you canâ€™t ask for such a high price because this is dangerous. So itâ€™s safety sat can be used by the payers as an argument against a very high price but this is a matter of negotiation. And you need QOL data, not to forget, this should be part of it.

15,119.a,"Yes, they did this, GBA had the decision on Cemiplimab in NSCLC in November of last year, so, not recently, and they split in NSCLC, they split these patients in the dossier in 2 different patient subpopulations. They had the 1L therapy, in this case with PD1, or they had this other one combined with PDL therapy or a combined therapy with PD1 and PDL. So they had 3 different populations, letâ€™s say, according to the therapeutic approach. You can read, this is quite complex to say by words because they took a lot of the drugs into it, but you have 2 pages full of different combinations and the dossier number of E-quick is A2287 and its on Cemiplimab and there are these subgroups defined by the GBA. But you are right, they divided it in these PD1 and PDL1 monotherapy or combined therapy.",DAI475
15,149,"I mean the price point would be parity to the average. This would be the transparent approach. It depends what they will choose, in principle it would work like this. ",DAI475
15,157,"metastatic and NSCLC, itâ€™s a phase III trial and has a comparator. Does a collection of 1L data impact your assessment or perceptions of the NSCLC population at all in 2L?]
No because you know the GBA is only evaluating what is on the EMA label and if the label is 2L, 1L data are of no use for the GBA discussions.",DAI475
15,162,"So, this is in Germany, completely different from other markets. The Germans, they are not looking at the previous piece, they are looking at the indication. If the same drug now is coming on a new indication, itâ€™s a new drug. They are looking on the evidence given by the clinical Phase III studies and whether its better of a comparator. So the previous price or indication doesnâ€™t matter for any discussion. Maybe the previous indication its an orphan indication with lets say 120 patients, now the drug has a new indication with 300,000 patients per year in Germany. So this is not the previous price is not an orientation point for the GBA and the payers, the KK, because they are looking very frankly on the clinical evidence and when there added value in comparison to the already established treatment in this specific indication. Itâ€™s a new game, and new conditions, new data, new evidence and this is completely separated.",DAI475
15,163,"[How is the price determined? ]
It depends on your clinical data you are providing, for the new indications. They look if you have your product in the new indication they look whether you are better or not then they look at the price of the comparators for example as an orientation pint. If you are better you get a premium price, higher than the comparator. If you are not better, they take the weighted average approach. 
[They need an overall price, they cant have an indication specific price right? ]
Lets say you have indication A, a price of 50,000 per patient per year. Now you have the same drug for indication B, but you get in the GBA rating, a level rating of 5 as a breakthrough innovation, so you can get indication B 150,000 per year per patient because your rating in indication B is the highest rating which is possible. So, you get 150,000 for the same drug in tis indication B and in indicant A you got only 50,000 because you wee only minor or moderate. So this is the price setting. It always depends on the added clinical benefit and the clinical evidence your client is bring into this game.
[Would the overall price for Product X, be a weighted average depending on the size of indication A versus the size of indication B? ]
I mean weighted average is only he case if your client has no added benefit. But, indication we just discussed trial C and as I told you this was quite interesting. 
[Are you saying that, now, in your example where product B is 150K a year, are you say that after it launches, the product is 150K, no matter what indication it is used for? ]
No, its 150K only in this indication, and this price is based on the data your client provided. If the data are very convincing and your client will get a rating 5 as breakthrough innovation and changes in therapeutic paradigm, then GBA say this is a great drug we need this for our patients and we think 150K is ok and is not a trend setter of other indications, Its only specific in this indication, it has no influence. It always depends on the clinical data in this indication. So, its separate, itâ€™s a closed shop every indication, is a very closed shop based only on the clinical evidence.
[So is there a way of paying 50K for some patients and 150K for other patients? ]
In different indications, yes. 50 in indication A and 150 in indication B, this is possible. 
[Do you think it makes sense to launch one after the other after the other or at the same time? ]
Yes, in principle this makes sense if you have convincing data, if you have phase III trials and you have a good trial design with international population including German patients and things like that which are ok for the GBA and if you have these clinical trials, the right comparators then you can launch both at the same time. This is very ok for the GBA. 
[Is there a benefit of launching them at the same time or launching them separately?]
No thereâ€™s no difference it depends purely on the clinical data you are presenting to the GBA. If you have in both indications lousy, unmature data, like Phase II and Asian patients, it doesnâ€™t matter whether you launch together or in sequence, because you will get anyway problems with the GBA. If you have mature data in Phase III trials in accordance with the GBA requirements, then you can go together or you can go in sequence and then you will get a premium price in both indications.",DAI475
15,176,"Gastric cancer, the GBA is now asking the companies for additional real world data, in this context they ask especially in orphan disease area, they ask the companies to collect data after launch and then these data are part of a conditional reimbursement period, they are part of the negotiation, So your client should be aware of this.
[Are there any example products where thatâ€™s been done in the past?]

In terms of the inclusion criteria, itâ€™s interesting - usually it doesn't say that a prior HER2 directed treatment,  it was only B, so with trial A we have no information on this. In terms of the patient relevant endpoints, median overall survival is patient relevant of course and the significant adverse events are also patient relevant, overall response rate likely not being accepted as patient relevant. [L: And would overall survival be accepted if it's measured as a key secondary endpoint?]

This is something where I can only describe that there is a relevant risk, because the guidelines do not say this cannot but only recommended for certain subpopulations in the second line, because if you look at the German Onkopedia guideline, for example, patients without any contraindications, it says that all Ramucirumab and Paclitaxel are the recommendation and to my knowledge thatâ€™s an in-label treatment options [ L: To clarify trial A is in a third line population, so I think the Ramucirumab and Paclitaxel might be second line] Ok, yes [I didn't mean to interrupt what you were going to say?]

M: so in the third lane or last line, it's either personalised recommendation or trifluridine or Taxane or irinotecan, so there's a higher probability that it is accepted by G-BA  [what do you think is the likelihood that the G-BA would accept a Trial comparator that's included in the guidelines but doesn't have an EMA label  ]

M: If we have no labelled options, and do you know if trifluridine has a third line label? [Yes]  Then it is difficult because the G-BA is usually not actively recommending off-label therapies, they usually say best supportive care or individualised treatment according to physician's choice. If there's an in label treatment with trifluridine available and the patient, which can be a problem in several cases - there was an oral treatment depending on the situation with the gastric for the patient - for those patients it could be accepted as physicianâ€™s choice, but for those patients where an in label treatment option is available, there's a there's a low probability that the G-BA accepts it. so yeah that's the situation.",DAI475
16,11.c,"[And then also one other point to call out on trial A. So in the design row, it was studied in an Asian population so that the trial population was from Japan and Korea. What are your thoughts on that?]

M: There's no formal requirement on the German HTA framework for German or European data, as long as there's no indication that due to another metabolic structure ,for example of the patients included in the clinical trial the results cannot be extrapolated or there is a risk that they are not relevant or comparable or could not be obtained in the same way than in a European population. Only then it's a problem, but there's no formal requirement and I'm not aware that with the chemotherapies we have, there are metabolic differences that would not allow to do a trial. So therefore to my understanding not a problem.",DAI475

Therefore here an idea what the patients reported because of the side effects and how their quality of life develops, that would be definitely useful   [For quality of life data, are you looking for no deterioration or are you looking for it just to be a better quality of life with product X compared to the comparator] 

M: Realistically here if I see a substantially higher degree of severe adverse events plus a 3x higher discontinuation rate, no negative impact on the quality of life I think would already be good and the optimistic case for me. Thinking of course an improvement in quality of life would be better, don't know don't get me wrong.

16,30,"Let's focus first on the third line population, so that's for trial a. So for this third line population what do you think would be the outcome of the G-BA assessment?
 
M: That's really tricky today what you asked me, because if the comparator is accepted, it could be I think a minor additional benefit: we have a substantial improvement in overall survival but also a substantial improvement in side effects, I think that's the best case. If a comparator in the third line is not accepted,  if they say  ok at least for the patient with an option for an oral therapy, they want XXX  trifluridine treatment. If the comparator is not accepted, it is definitely an a no addiitonal benefit rating.  [Now let's focus on the second line outcome. So for second line with the single arm trial, assuming you would expect a no added benefit because it's a single trial.]

M: Yes, big surprise. ",DAI475
16,30.a,"As we have found out, as we have different comparator therapies, I think there's a high chance that the G-BA will define different comparators also in the assessment.",DAI475
16,31.a.i,"[So if it was a no added benefit rating, do you think it would just be trifluridine that would be considered as the appropriate comparator?]

M: I think that's the highest likelihood, or they define two subgroups. But then there would be data for one sub group for the Taxane /Irinotecan population and that could be a benefit rating for that population and no additional benefit rating for the other. But honestly but in such a situation it would be really really important to go through it through a structured early advice process with G-BA quite early to avoid negative surprises at the end of the day  --- [And then we discussed that the appropriate comparative therapy might be considered Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel. I didn't want to ask - so recently Keytruda was assessed in the MSI high subpopulation of GC and in their assessment they considered the appropriate comparator therapy for second line to be a physician's choice of irinotecan ,docetaxel, paclitaxel and this Ramucirumab  plus paclitaxel. So they listed those different options. I mean would you expect the same approach for assessing the possible appropriate comparator therapies or the basket for this population as well?]

M: Yes. Keytrude is only in - do you know the outcome of the benefit rating? 

[L: OK so for second line, they had a single arm trial and so it was no added benefit, and then so in their assessment they listed the appropriate comparator therapies as paclitaxel, irinotecan and some of these other options.]

M:  Then it will be very likely it will be the same comparative basket, because the G-BA is quite reluctant to include drugs with the no additional benefit rating in the clinical comparator basket. First statement. And then in terms of price comparator of course health insurances will try to tie you to the cheapest options out of the clinical comparator basket and then you really need to negotiate and see if it's possible to obtain an agreement by referencing to guidelines, to real life prescription data and would definitely suggest the claims data analysis here to demonstrate what is the real life treatment paradigm, because otherwise there is a risk that you end up with the price of the chemotherapy in the price negotiation. You do not have a right to be priced in relation to the most expensive comparator",DAI475
16,33,"For me it would be second and third line because if I understand the current treatment paradigm correctly, the HER2 targeted treatment is the standard of care in the first line, then that label, the product would be licenced for all use after the first line and therefore not being restricted to the second line.",DAI475
16,34.d,"[And then on the comparator data: are indirect treatment comparisons ever valuable, so an indirect treatment comparison verse Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel in second line. Is that ever considered?]

M: The G-BA can consider indirect comparisons but they ask for adjusted indirect comparisons, so you have quite high methodological hurdle, but generally it is possible. They are not obliged to accept it because you always have to explain why a head-to-head trial was impossible, but anyway if you submit an adjusted indirect comparison, you can at least try to use this to obtain a positive benefit rating. ",DAI475
16,69,"[So for that third line population, how would price then be determined ?]

M: As always based on the degree of additional benefit plus the taking into account the size of the patient population and at the cost of comparators - that's the standard approach how the G-Ba works, not only how the G-BA works but how the prices is negotiated. And as you have here, this at the end of the day then the question is what do you want as a comparator - the chemotherapies are relatively cheap, a few thousand euros, 5,6,7 thousand euros per year, and trifluridine is about 30,000 per year I think. So I think realistically best case but also realistic case, you end at the trifluridine price because either you have a minor additional benefit if the chemo comparator is accepted, then you have a compatible benefit rating to trifluridine and can achieve comparible price , then we are around about this 30,000 euro's per year. And worst case if the G-BAâ€™s says trifluridine is the comparator, then you have no additional benefit rating versus the a drug that costs 30,000 euros a year, get another maybe 10% discount according to the new rules for pricing. And then you are slightly below the trifluridine price but not too much below. I think in both cases we will discuss tonight, it will be in the Ball Park of something between 30 -33 thousand, 27 thousand euro somewhere in that ballpark with the current information we have 

[L: We had also heard the 10% discount within no added benefit. Is that like implemented right now or is that going to be implemented in the future?]
M:  It's part of the new law that was established at the end of the year and we will see how it is really done and incorporated at the price negotiation. But for all future price negotiations with suppliers 
---[ L: So I have a question on that: when you have a basket of comparitors here in the no added benefit scenario, when do they look at the weighted average price of the comparators vs reference the lowest price comparator in the basket?]

M:  When you can demonstrate that the lowest price comparator is not frequently used, is not the standard option in treating the patients, because the legal framework says if there's no other evidence available the price comparator is the cheapest clinical comparator. 

[L: So they only look at the weighted average if you can show that the cheapest one isn't representative of standard of care in practise?]

M: Exactly, and ideally not representative in terms of sales volume, of course not in euros but in patients treated. And also that clinicians say there's subpopulation  of 30-40% where we never start with irinotecan.  If you if you can make such a case, then you can change this but you do not have a kind of right to say okay we have a three or five products in the clinical comparative basket, so I want to be compared vs a basket. Honestly on the other hand, you don't have to do an RCT vs all 5 - a component of the clinical comparator basket is sufficient if you compare against one.  So this is positive for the manufacturer when doing the RCT concepts, but of course the price negotiation they have the advantage situation that the stand up price competitor is the cheapest option.",DAI475
16,79.a,"if I do not did not miss anything, we have here a labelled comparator which will be very likely accepted by G-BA , we may have a patient relevant endpoint, the overall survival assuming it's alslo statistically significant the substantial improvement, and I would say non- inferiority on safety compared to the comparator - both have many side effects, but honestly 75% of adverse events or 82 it's both a lot.

[Do you look at the you look at the combined price of the regimen] Yes [okay then it would be around 60.]

M: it would be a no added benefit with a very easy assessment, because of the first exercise of the G-BA is to identify are there RCTs that have the potential to demonstrate an additional benefit and then the G-BA assess the trial duration is not acceptable or no comparator , then they can close the book and then the outcome is no additional benefit rating, but without analysing the data anymore - they just say that the trial is not sufficient to demonstrate a positive benefit rating. --- [I guess we're anticipating a no added benefit here and would you expect the G-BA to identify sub-populations for the benefit assessment or based on the prior chemotherapy treatment like we mentioned before or since its no added benefit would it just be one population.]

First of all, what do you want to do â€“ outcomes based, patients donâ€™t live very long anymore, so  do they pay back when the patients die? So how to measure outcomes here is very difficult. And thereâ€™s also not really a willingness to keep drugs in the market at a high price where there is no sufficient clinical data, and I personally would expect here in an area where we have many other treatments available to say ok weâ€™ll keep it a relatively low price and happy if you come back if you have head-to-head data and then do a reassessment and renegotiate the price. In such a case where we have a really weak clinical case using so-called innovative contracting to push it more into the patient than into use â€“ why? 
So, for me, unless clinicians tell me something different, from what I see here it is not really looking like a game change for the patient so why any innovative contracting. And its very easy, the pricing framework is very clear, price will be low and that's it. So why should the health insurances pay more with the hope for a better efficacy or the hope to get some money back. ",DAI475
16,149,"[L: So for this assessment for the no added benefit, do you think the price would be referenced to the weighted average price of the different comparators, or to the cheapest comparator?]
M: There is a high tendency to price it vs the cheapest comparator because nobody wants to pay a lot of money for cost for product without comparative data â€“ so that would at least a strong push towards trying to keep the price as low as possible.  
[L: So, here considering some agents like docetaxel or Pemetrexed are potential options, do you think they would expect a price per year thatâ€™s equivalent to some of those options,  like 13,000 I think is docetaxel per year?]
M: That would be at least the expectation, so I would not see it in a pembro  space for example , because for all the reasons we mentioned. So there will be a high price pressure, I think especially for NSCLC there so many targeted treatments also with positive benefit ratings, and I think there will not be much positive perception for a drug coming with a single arm trial design, so docetaxel here it's about 12,13 thousand, more than 20,000 I would be sceptical. [L: so there are also other targeted treatments being developed in NSCLC for different mutations separate from HER2. Do those serve as any sort of indirect price reference, or what are your thoughts there.]

M: Of course they are there for indirect price references, but it will be a question what kind of benefit rating did they obtain. So you cannot say I have something with a positive benefit rating, you cannot really use it as a price reference for something with no additional benefit rating or evenings where even a â€¦.   Is a treatment option. Yes they are there, people have it in mind, but with a no additional benefit rating single arm study its very difficult to use a product with a positive benefit rating and therefore a high price as a price reference.",DAI475
16,157,"[1L trial, impact assessment? ] M:  I think so. If I remember correctly an accepted clinical comparator  and then there's a chance to obtain a positive benefit rating, so that's with such a comparator arm. I'm just thinking but you, Pembro as an option for the PD-1 low, we have other options, so that sounds sensible. And with such a trial design there's at least some potential to demonstrate a positive benefit. [L: So if the trial was in first line and the two assessments we were looking at previously are in second and third line, do you think this new head-to-head trial data in first line would impact any of the previous assessments in second line or third line ]

M: No.

[L: OK so it would only be if the EMA  label was updated to first line and then they re-assessed this product in first line?]

M: Exactly.",DAI475
16,162,"It's quite predictable, you have a negotiated price for the first indication and defined patient population from the G-BA assessment. And then second indication is assessed, the price is negotiated for the second indication based on the degree of additional benefit, size of patient population, cost of comparators in that new population, then as a result you have a price and your cost per patient in year in the new indication and the definition of eligible patients and then a blend price is calculated as a weighted average out of the results of the negotiations.

[L: And for that patient population - are you just looking at the number of total eligible patients, so like 300 patients and that indication or 1000 patients in that indication, or are you accounting for changes in dosing between indications or how long the patient is expected to be on treatment based on progression free survival ]
M: First of all the G-BA defines the number of eligible patients not based on the expected market share of a product but on the overall number of patients for whom the treatment is in labour, so that's the first number the G-BA puts in the dossier. The price negotiation is about annual costs per patient, so the price negotiation has basically two steps - in the first step, there is an agreement on annual costs, so like we had it before whatever Ramicrumab plus paclitaxel is annual cost of 60,000 euros, we have a positive survivor benefit so we agree to pay 80,000 per patient per year on average - that's the first part of the price negotiation for the new indication. Then of course the price per vial per mg has to be determined in the new indication, and then it depends- is it a weight-based dosage, what is our assumption about the average time the treatment is continued and so on. These are then assumptions that have to be agreed in the price negotiation and then after 1-2 years out of the real life prescription data, there's reevaluation of the agreed price agreement results in the anticipated annual costs, and if not, itâ€™s analysed and the prices are adjusted - that's the way it works , so for this question how long are patients on treatment on average, it's about assumptions 

[L: so in terms of calculating that weighted average price just initially before the two year reassessment for that initial weighted average calculation. Wait I guess the question: when we're talking about considering the price per mg and how long the patient would take treatment - is that just to calculate the anticipated annual cost or is that accounted for when they are calculating the new weighted average price of the product?]

M: The step is first you agree on cost per year per indication and then you have to bring this down to costs if there's only one wire with whatever XXX  substance. Then you have to do this calculation for each of the indication, what the anticipated treatment duration,  whats the average body weight of a patient whose gastric cancer, of a patient with NSCLC and then come to a conclusion. That's the way how it is how it works, so first of all defining the average cost per patient per year, and then thinking about you can then calculate. If the dosing is identical then of course you can do a blended price for the cost per year at first, out of the agreed price for indication A and indication B, and then you can calculate the cost per mg depending on the anticipated treatment duration . But it can also be more complex if you have different treatment schemes in both indications: then you have to do it in earlier steps so that's quite complex.",DAI475
16,163,"[. I guess my question to you would be do you see any benefit in launching or negotiating the price in indication B and gastric cancer at the same time, as opposed to if we if they did one after the other 
does it make a difference?]

M: It is more efficient, it saves some cost for some lawyers and so o,  but at the end of the day there's a benefit rating for each indication. Even if you negotiated in, so there is no reason to wait to launch another indication I would say, but the mechanism is as I described - you have the benefit rating, the estimation of the patient population, cost of the comparator and this exercise will be done for both indications, even if you submit in parallel. So it's for the outside it's a maybe you have then only one change in price, it's not that transparent what was the price in indication B, what was the price in AGC,  because it's only a new blended price then reflecting indication three indication if you add B and aGC together.so that's more a strategic advantage but not really an advantage in terms of price potential.

[L: OK, so if one of indications had a considerable added benefit and one has a no added benefit it's not better to launch them together so that it minimises the concerns around the minor added benefit - there's no benefit to that?]

M: Not really because as I said that there will be always an agreement on a price per patient per year for each of the new indications. You cannot avoid this discussion. You cannot say ok we have two I want 65,000 euros, they will do it in the structure that I mentioned, but as I said the it's of course not visible for competitors, for example what was the result of the negotiation for indication B and what was the result of the negotiation for the gastric cancer, because if you do it in parallel and then you have at the same time a change in price, then this is, it's more strategic advantage but not so much an advantage in terms of getting more money at the end of the day",DAI475
16,165.a,"[L: And then is it ever possible for the price to increase after these calculations about the new indication, if it's maybe the standalone price for the new indication is really high and maybe it's and so based on based on the weighted average price is it ever possible for the price to increase?]

M: Yes of course, you can increase the price if you have a either better benefit rating in the new indication which is added, and/or a more expensive comparator. A quite famous example recently where the SGLT2 inhibitors which started with no or minor additional benefit due to hypoglycemia and diabetes and then CV XXX  mortality data, empaglifozin got 50% price increase from 120 to 180 and dapa for example with a mortality benefit in heart failure, they went up from 120 to 2 euro 50 blended price reflecting about 5 euro for the heart failure indication â€“ so that's possible yes.",DAI475
17,1,Substantially correct - from one side GC is a great unmet need in IT and Europe. The separation between 2nd and 3L substantially is correct because GC patients in IT are still alive after months if not years whereas in the past they would die quickly. There are a number of patients in 2L or 3L - 3L treated with supportive care if failed therapy,DAI475
17,1.b,"When we discuss budget impact of disease, the payers in IT know the number of diagnosed patients and number of patients undergoinng surgery or treatment but know very little about the patient subgroups. Obviously know that in hospital they have 382 patients affected by GC. Know these patients were hospitalised they know if underwent surgery or medical treatment but cannot substantially know anything about the 2L and 3L therapy resistance and other details. Their judgement is based on number of affected patients and other situations that are relevant because if have hospital majority of patients in 1L and another hospital with majority in 3L, budget impact will be totally divergent but they cannot know the exact details about the cancer population. Can be further complicated by the fact in IT, the patient can start with the treatment in this region then switch to another hosp in the same region or another region. For instance several patients several patients go to Milan or Rome. In this condition very hard for payer to know these details because healtthcare system in IT divided in 20 regions.

Similar to CNS cancer for example because patients with aGC and 2L, 3L according to the question often manifest with marked frailty related to disease, difficulties in feeding to concomitant diseases that are frequent with immune suppression. Therefore, in HER2+ or HER2- patients, not so different the impact of disease is extremely relevant. Cost of disease related to cancer treatment, not only gastric treatment. Have to promote health in these patients for the rest of their lives in order to support patient who usually manifest with loss of muscles, inability to swallow any food, frequent bleedings. Common difficults in giving these patient all drugs that a middle aged persn usually deserves - aspirin, statins are frequently withdrawn in these patients.

17,3.c,"[is cost of disease relating to treatment biggest driver?] in some patients substantially the main driver is related to cancer therapy and the remainder is modest. Even considering some cost related to supportive therapy that are not covered by healthcare system. For example, the supplemental food with the right amount of nutrients and calories for these patients. Drugs are covered by healthcare system but the supplementary foods not given for free so patients and their families have to pay. Therefore, in some patients, not more than 40% that are still in acceptable clinical condition, the main driver is therapy. The other patients, its half and half, about 60%. They are immuno repressed, advanced leukocytopeania, internal bleeding. In these patients the cost of anticancer therapy is important. There is a general margin related to complications, penumonia which is if not more important is as important as cancer therapy. Particularly in patients affected by osopharngeal and gastric cancer the clinical and economic burden is related to complications even because hospitalisation in some patients affected by GC. Bleeding episode, patient can stay a week in the hospital. One complication usually causes a second one etc. In 30-40% of patients economic burden is associated with cancer therapy.

The situation is jeopradised but it is correct that in the case of contraindication cyramza is used. It is true that ironetecan and keytruda are used in 2L never in the 1L therapy. The 3L also I agree. In some patients, taxane and irinotecan are considered 3L but this is not so common. In this institution, Irinotocen is almost always 3Ltherapy in GC in some institutions. In other institutions, irotecan can be 2L therapy. The slide is correct, this is usual treatment pathway followed in IT",DAI475
17,5.a,"4,4,5",DAI475
17,5.c,"In my personal opinion, the fact is that HER2 positive identify as black/white population, but there are different clinical conditions that can suggest, if not strongly indicate you, that a patient can strongly manifest with severe side effects when treated with traditional chemotherapy. And this is a fact â€“ genotype is not so perfect to identify the clinical, real components of each patient. And this is an unmet need that is relevant. I love precision medicine, we all like precision medicine, but at the end of the history there are a number of considerations that cannot be considered in the ESMO guidelines; that you consider when you are in front of your patient, because you know that Trastuzumab is substantially well tolerated, but it is not the same for chemotherapy. Keytruda is also substantially well tolerated, but this is not the same for chemotherapy that can induce more side effects in comparison to Tastuzumab and Keytruda, and at the end of the history can deteriorate patient quality of life in a very, very marked manner, much more than the biologic treatment with Tastuzumab or Pembrolizumab. This is the first aspect. The second aspect - I am not the only one who is convinced about this aspect - we say â€“ there is also a third aspect â€“ but the second one is that HER2 positive is a sort of white condition. This is not totally true, because the positivity can be very marked or can be very modest. And there are patients who are softly positive and can be categorised as a negative â€“ but are not negative. And there are patients who are modestly positive and who are categorised as positive, but there is a huge variation with some patient with a marked positivity, and some patients who are slightly positive. The third aspect is clinical and economical at the same time. This is a nice algorithm and is totally correct; you prepared the algorithm better than a fellow oncologist. But I have to say first that the quality of life of this patient is frequently modest whatever the treatment. This is because food ingestion, pills ingestion is very very difficult in this patient and therefore they lose body weight. The burden of the disease is not correctly interpreted by overall survival, and the quality of life is markedly disturbed. The disease, second in the same third unmet need, at the end of the history, the prognosis of this specific gastric cancer, particularly when you have the involvement of the oesophagus, the prognosis is not good. At the end of the history you are in front of the patient whose quality of life is modest or relatively modest, enter into depression, enter in sarcopenia, and at the end of the history die the same frequency.",DAI475
17,10,"Let me see the overall response rate is 50%, it is significant, and the payer want to see the significance. Therefore, this is a good point in favour of product X. There are some key secondary endpoints too â€“ the mean overall survival, it is 4 months more, therefore it is good, and in trial A, vs irinotecan/paclitaxel, progression free survival is increased by two months. Under the efficacy profile, since we are in a condition with a modest progress, since the patients have been already treated with several older biologic/ anti-cancer therapies, I am satisfied looking at this. Even considering the judgement as a payer, it is a good response â€“ it is not the French revolution, but particularly the increment in overall response rate. It is a pity that we have no data on patient QoL. But again, as I already mentioned, in this patient is particularly relevant. But in any case, the efficacy profile is good. 
Now, let me see safety data.  The safety data is not so good. As a clinician, this does not represent a specific problem. As a payer, 15% vs 5% of this continuation, this obviously gives me the impression that product X can be introduced in the market in Italy with a payment for result, because you have a number of patients who cannot take the drug properly â€“ they start with the treatment but the treatment is interrupted. I do not know that after one week or after six months â€“ in any case, the drug is interrupted. And for the payer, this is not a good argument in favour of the introduction in the market. But therefore the safety profile is not so good. Obviously is not an obstacle regarding introduction in the market; it is an obstacle for the pricing procedure, excepting the possibility of introducing the drug into the market with the payment for result. That means, ok, you prescribe the drug to 100 patients, 85 patient remain at .. with no therapy, and therefore I would not pay for this patients. This is normal, at least in Italy, for cancer therapy. With regard to trial B, second line. Let me see the efficacy. We have no comparator but efficacy sounds good. Overall survival is substantially equivalent to trial A, and therefore probably this in support of relevance of trial A. With regard to side effects â€“ there is no second arm, but it is evident that the discontinuation rate is not so high, its 9%, probably related to the fact that these patients are just a little bit less complicated in comparison to the patient enrolled in trial A. So at the end of the history, efficacy is good, it is a point in favour of product X. The only concern is related to safety. The safety profile, at least in comparison to irinotecan/paclitaxel, is not in favour of product X. It indicates that the trial results, both trials, indicate that the tolerability of the drug is not so good. But, in any case, again, we are talking about cancer, we are talking about patients with metastasis. And therefore, I do not want to say absolutely, who cares, no, it is not true â€“ we care. But obviously, for instance, I would prescribe this drug, because the overall response rate is markedly higher than with paclitaxel, and therefore it is better.",DAI475

Therefore, it is substantially Caucasian, and it â€¦ groups related to Asian population. But at the end of the history, the trial is a trial, and therefore it is relevant. I can imagine that AIFA would ask for some additional data for patient studied in Europe, but in any case there are no reason to indicate that a study conducted in Asian population, at least as regard gastric cancer, is characterised by totally divergent responses, in comparison to an Italian patient. In mean it is true â€“ the Asian population manifest with different severity of the disease, different epidemiology of the disease, to somewhat â€¦ and probably a different response to therapy. But at the end of the history, it is not so different. Therefore, it is possible, if not likely, that AIFA will ask for a supplement of data in European patient. But it is not a substantial obstacle, it is not a wall in front of the introduction of the drug in the market. Even because you have a second trial, that is trial B, substantially indicating you the same identical data in comparison to trial A.

It is a possible choice, but there are other possible choices, and several patients in the third line have been treated or not with this type of approach. This is correct. And I think it is thought of all the oncologists, internists and what ever you want. Therefore, the choice of comparator is acceptable, but at the same time debateable. We can discuss for days. But at the end of the history, we commented that during the meetings of the regional committee, a number of cancer trials conducted without comparator, conducted with a comparator that is not more used in clinical practical, combined with one comparator as in this case that is not the only one can be used. At the end of the history, in this case, frankly speaking, who cares. We are talking about metastatic cancer. And therefore it is usual, at least in Italy, that a drug, even considering that the trial probably is not statistically powered, but is acceptable. Therefore, as a researcher, I would like to have different treatment, Asian, European, North American, sub-population.

[Would you expect the product to be reimbursed in second-line and later, or just third line. From the current profile, what are your expectations there?] This is a good question. Obviously, the indication is narrow at the second line, and therefore the indication, the official indication, will be: the drug can be given to patient after a surgery of unresectable, after a first line therapy failure â€“ this is the indication that AIFA will give to product X. But this is correct. Therefore, the reimbursement is warrant only in patient in second line. But, when a patient is hospitalised, if the oncologist opinion is related to the possibility of quality of life, quantity of life, can be improved by giving product X to a patient as a first line therapy; again, product X. In Italy, the one thing is the official indication, but the other one is if the oncologist think that this therapy is better, even as a first or a third line, and not only as second line, it is very difficult for AIFA to stop the reimbursement. Therefore, my reply is in the grey zone. Obviously, the indication of AIFA will be: ok, I will reimburse you this drug as a second line therapy, because the trial has been conducted in second line, I have no evidence of this drug efficacy as a first line one. This is the official indication. But at the end of the history, if an oncologist will give this drug to a patient in first line, this drug will be reimbursed the same. ",DAI475
17,39,"At the end the history, they want to see, they want to have data produced by manufacturer regarding budget impact and cost effectiveness. The willingness-to-pay must be calculated by manufacturer, because AIFA is concerned about the cost in cancer that is obviously increasing in Italy, because the patient does not die within a few weeks â€“ and we are very glad this. Therefore, the cost of each gastric cancer increases. On the other side, the cost effectiveness is considered as relevant, but at the end of the history the real aspect that they consider is the old history: how many patient we have, how many patient will receive product X, the cost of any patient will be X, the cost of every ear per patient will be Z â€“ these are the real aspect. I mean that AIFA want to see the cost effectiveness in order to decide the price of a drug, but at the end of the history the most important finding that they want to analyse is the number of patient, the number of treated patient, the cost per patient and finally the cost per year. Therefore, cost without efficacy, is considered the basis for the final decision. 
[Ok, and then do you think that AIFA would conduct a single assessment, or whether there would be a separate assessment for the second line population and the third line population. ]
 AIFA is changing its rule, but I do think there is no reason to divide, to split the judgement. ",DAI475
17,40,"[For that second line and later population, what level of innovation would you expect for product X. ]
Obviously, the manufacturer, in my opinion, must try to obtain the innovation, because the processâ€¦ faster, because the price is usually a little bit higher. But honestly, Iâ€™m not convinced that this product will obtain the patent of innovation. [Do you think it would be conditionally innovative, instead of full innovative]. This is more likely, conditional innovation. [And why do you think conditionally innovative]. In this case, I think since the advantages for the manufacturer are not high as in the case of unconditional innovation. I see more possibilities that the innovative patent will be given. Iâ€™m not sure, Iâ€™m not sure 100% that innovation will be given. But in the case of a conditional one, it is possible. 
[ So then, are there any different innovative contracting that you think would address any AIFA concerns or that would be interested. I know you mentioned the payment schemes in terms of only paying for the patients that respond on therapy. Is that the primary one that you would expect, or would you expect any other innovative contracting. ]
My personal opinion, the two restrictions AIFA will ask for this drug and that the region will confirm, is the budget that is decided before the launch of the drug into the market. And therefore, AIFA will probably say: we have a number of patient characterised by this type of cancer, I do not want to spend 10million euro, to give a number, first. Therefore, the ceiling of the budget, I do not want to pay more, if the prescription will bypass this limitation, I will not pay you. This is very common in cancer therapy, very common. Usually, I have to say, the ceiling is never reached â€“ never no, but is rarely reached. Second, Iâ€™m sure, this is my conviction, based on the high rate of discontinuation, that the payment for result will be imposed to this drug. Because 15% confirmed by trial B in European population, 9% that is 10%, several patient affected by pneumiona, therefore increasing the rate of at least â€¦. Discontinuation. And therefore, in my personal opinion, concordant to other treatment, even in other fields, not only in the field of cancer, this drug will be introduced in the market with payment for result. If not, several regions will ask for payment for result, and they can impose restriction that have not been imposed by AIFA.",DAI475

On the other side, the cost effectiveness is considered as relevant, but at the end of the history the real aspect that they consider is the old history: how many patient we have, how many patient will receive product X, the cost of any patient will be X, the cost of every ear per patient will be Z â€“ these are the real aspect. I mean that AIFA want to see the cost effectiveness in order to decide the price of a drug, but at the end of the history the most important finding that they want to analyse is the number of patient, the number of treated patient, the cost per patient and finally the cost per year. Therefore, cost without efficacy, is considered the basis for the final decision. 
[ Ok, and then do you think that AIFA would conduct a single assessment, or whether there would be a separate assessment for the second line population and the third line population. ] AIFA is changing its rule, but I do think there is no reason to divide, to split the judgement. ",DAI475
17,69,"Let me look at slide 7. Because we are going from 10,000 â€¦ for Keytruda to 400 euro for irinotecan. 
[On that slide, so dashed bars represent up to list price, and then the solid coloured bars are what we are approximating to be the net price for some of these products. So weâ€™re estimating around a 60% list-net for Opdivo and Keytruda and a 40% for some of these other agents like Cyramza and Lonsurf. Iâ€™m not sure if that is generally accurate or if you think that estimate is off a bit. ]
This is a drug acting in a different manner, and I assume that it is not used for other type of cancer. Therefore, it is not present in the Italian market. This is mandatory, because if it is present for other type of cancer, obviously the price cannot be different from the price that the drug already has. 
[Lets assume for this conversation that this is the first indication that it launches in. ]
 In the case of the first indication ,it is absolutely reasonable for the manufacturer to ask for a price that is the highest in company.  In all the â€¦ classes, the â€¦. Friends use it for the treatment of gastric cancer. Obviously, as it usual in the negotiation with AIFA, the manufacturer will ask to AIFA: ok, we have a number of drugs, the cost is very different, but you pay 10,000 euro per treatment in a patient receiving Keytruda, and therefore the price of my drug goes to the price of Keytruda, why not. This is the usual first step in the negotiation. In my opinion, is a correct manner to approach to negotiation with AIFA. Because if you start from the highest price first it is â€¦ Because I have positive data, and you already treat a number of patient with a very expensive drug. Second, the MoA is different, and therefore there are all the expenses related to the development of a novel drug â€“ in this case, an antibody. Therefore, in my opinion at the end of the history, one can ask for a price that is located close to the price of Keytruda, and in any case close and even higher to the price of Cyramza.
[Ok, so you think it would be around 4000, 4,400 euros, or do you think that the net price of those products is different that that, like higher or lower.]
At the present time, it is about 1 year that AIFA tried to reduce the final net price, and therefore probably the introduction of Keytruda during this year will be 10,000 euro list price, 3,000-3,500 the net final price. Even considering this aspect, I think that at the end of the history, the final net price, considering a similar list price, will be not specifically different, just a little bit lower for Product X in comparison to Keytruda â€“ just a little bit higher additional discount.",DAI475
17,69.c,"[ lets assume Product X is reimbursed for that second line or later population and it gets conditionally innovative status. What price range would you expect be negotiated for this Product X?]
My opinion, as usual, the range will be a little bit higher, because you have some argument in favour and also the negotiation will be faster, more rapid, in the case of innovation. And therefore, honestly, in my personal opinion, it is extremely difficult to believe in a price that will be higher than the price of Keytruda. I do think that probably the range will be, again, between Cyramza and Keytruda, but closer at the end of the history to Keytruda. Obviously, in the case of those positive aspect in favour of product X, the final net price will be, I expect that it will be not lower than the Keytruda price, but substantially the same identical Keytruda net price.
[why do you think the Keytruda price, as opposed to the Cyramza price. Because the Cyramza product is used in second line pretty frequently ; it seems like it is the standard of care in line. So I would just think maybe that would be the reference,  more so than the Keytruda price that would said would be 3,000.]
At the end of the history, honestly, I am not so convinced, that the price Cyramza in all of the Italian hospital, is higher than the price of Keytruda. Probably there are local negotiation leading to the reduction in the final net price of Cyramza to a lower rate in comparison to Keytruda. In any case, in my personal opinion, Product X is a drug that is from a certain extent better than the drugs that are listed in slide 7. This is because the patient response is better â€“ for instance, Cyramza can be used in a minority of patients, and at the end of the history is not so frequently used in several patients. It is characterised by, as usual for this type of drugs, it is not strange, side effects limiting the continuation of the therapy. Therefore, my personal opinion again, the final cost of Product X, net cost I mean, will be close to 4,000 if not more 

[Oh ok, 4,000 or more.]",DAI475

17,100,"Substantially, I have not the possibility to comment on the efficacy, because there are no efficacy data in trial 1; there are only efficacy in trial 2, with no comparator. And therefore, the data, even considering that the disease is by definition an advanced one because of unrespectability or presence of metastasis, it is not so easy for me to comment on the efficacy data, because it is not evident if the drug offers to the patient an improvement in the quantity of life, in overall survival, in overall response rate and so on. Assuming that in cancer patient that cannot be treated by surgery and therefore with an intermediate to short life expectancy, it seems to me that the drug is able to be characterised by, compared to the therapy that we have at the present time, is characterised by a substantial improvement in the overall response rate. And so: based on an indirect comparison, I can state that the therapy is improved by product X, the result of the therapy are improved by product X. This is the first consideration.
The safety profile substantially sounds sufficiently good. The prevalence and the incidence of drug related adverse event is acceptable for a biologic agent. I have no data in front of me regarding discontinuation of the therapy that for the Italian payer is the most important aspect. But in any case, it sounds as a novel drug that is able to improve life expectancy in a little cancer disease. Obviously the patient studied population is modest; the total number of the patient is 150. In general, this drug sounds as an advantage, 60% of patient reaching an overall response rate with 1 year and a half of mean overall survival; and 7 months of progression free survival is substantially not a terrific response, but for sure a good response in a very severe form of cancer.",DAI475
17,106,"3,There is no comparator, therefore it is very unlikely that the drug will be judged as an innovative one. In comparison to what â€¦. There are therapies for NSCLC, and therefore, in my opinion, the innovative patent, obviously the manufacturer, as in all the cases, has to ask, they must ask for innovation, but AIFA will deny innovation of this drug. There is no comparator, it is not possible to define that this drug is better than another one. Only singular studies, therefore, my opinion, it is very difficult to believe that innovation will be given for this drug. 
The second aspect. Substantially, the therapy of this type of cancer, I mean HER2 mutant, is not standardised; the approach is based, for sure, on guidelines, but also on complex therapy, based on mixture of different chemotherapies, biologic agents. Therefore, the patient responses to all the therapies is not expected to be homogenous, and the possibility to have a single drug, not to be used in a mixture subsequent therapies, I think it is positive for patient QoL and the possibility to obtain an additional delay in the progression of the disease. Therefore, at the end of the history, I do think the drug will be accepted to AIFA, even considering that the quality of the trial, the two trials, is very modest. Again, in the field of cancer, the quality as this one is accepted, at least in Italy.",DAI475
17,125," I do think the drug will be accepted to AIFA, even considering that the quality of the trial, the two trials, is very modest. Again, in the field of cancer, the quality as this one is accepted, at least in Italy. ",DAI475
17,149,"This is a good question. If I remember well, you gave me a landscape of the price of this type of cancer [Its on slide 14]. And again, for the price, it varies from Pembrolizumab to Docetaxel. Therefore, this is the last arrived, they can offer an improvement in life expectancy; substantially, I am surprised, but side effects sound better in this form of disease in comparison to gastric cancer. And therefore, the manufacturer would ask for a price during the negotiations that is closer to the price of Keytruda. Obviously, without any additional data, AIFA will try to reply that it is not possible to state the product X is better than Avastin, the old Avastin, that is frequently used in this type of patient. But in any case, 60% to overall response rate authorises, in my opinion, the manufacturer to ask for a price that is closer to Keytruda. Obviously, the negotiation at variance from the negotiation with gastric cancer will be more difficult, because we have no data in comparison with other drugs. And in all of the cases, it is very easy for the AIFA expert, even on the region level, to try to force manufacturer in accepting a lower price because they have no data indicating that their product is better. And this is a pity for the manufacturer. But in any case, I do think that in other fields, as in other cancer drug, the manufacturer should ask, and should start, with a negotiation asking price that is closer to the price of Keytruda â€“ that is to say, the highest.",DAI475
17,162,"[Ok, so a couple of quick questions I have for you at the end. So, if you want to go to slide 26. Iâ€™ll just walk you through some assumptions here, but I just want to get your perspective on â€“ like you said â€“ so AIFA wonâ€™t increase the price if youâ€™re expanding from one indication to the second. But when you do expand from one indication to the second, to the third, is there a minimum price discount that AIFA would be expecting, or that would be expected?]
 Yes,  this is very common and usually the reduction in price expanding the indication, in the better of the case, is 10%, at least 10% of the initial price. I do believe that since this type of cancers are not so common - common, but not as common as colic cancers, for instance â€“ they will be satisfied by a reduction in about 10-15% and no more. Because the number of patient is not so high.",DAI475
17,164,"Yes,  this is very common and usually the reduction in price expanding the indication, in the better of the case, is 10%, at least 10% of the initial price.

Because the number of patient is not so high.",DAI475
17,174,"So I guess to that point, I have a question, so ok, on slide 26: we have, there are a lot of indications, they are in the different colours. So say, product X is available in indication A, that bright blue box, and itâ€™s 6,000 per month. So then its thinking in launching in two additional indications â€“ indication B and gastric cancer. And you said the gastric cancer price, as a standalone, might be around 4,000. And then lets assume that the indication B, that it would be around 5,500. And together, that increase in population accounting for treatment duration, PFS â€“ accounting for all of that â€“ it would be around a 70% increase in the total treatment. With that expansion, what discount would you expect from that 6,000 per month. If we do it based on a weighted average, thinking that the next indications are 5,500 and 4,000, the first one was 6,000, based on a weighted average, its still around 5,500 which would only be a 7% decrease in price. But what are your expectations there?
In my opinion, the cost of the drug for this standalone prices is substantially the same â€“ its 6,000 per month vs 5,500 per month. Therefore, at the end of the history, the changes in the indication relate to a tremendous increment in the number of patient: it is plus 70% in second line, remaining with the previous indication if other drugs will not arrive. And so in my personal opinion, as it was the case, for instance,  â€¦.. , just to mention that was included in a previous evolution, the reduction in price will be about at least 20%. And this is because the increment in population size is considerable. It is true that the increment, some increments are not so relevant, but in general, the population is markedly increased by the second indication. So the final price, in my opinion, will be decreased by 20%. 
[So it sounds like the price decrease isnâ€™t necessarily based on the weighted avg price, because it is increasing but the value for indication B is almost the same as the value for indication A â€“ at 6,550 â€“ but they donâ€™t think about a weighted average price or the value of the second indication?]
In my opinion, AIFA will ask for a net discount with no differences based on the result. Medium discount for the more initial price of the drug, with no specific changes. 

[20% discount from 6000 so we are at 4800, 2% increase in population, what price change?] Not convinced prescription increased by 2% because the type of cancer is substantially more with the additional indication so the 2% is only xxx to lung cancer, not relevant IMO. Not the end of the history. [population increase is only 2%] Pop already increased by change in indication. First indication = 100, then change from 100 to 200 then further increase by 2%. The final 2% is from one side correct, but at the end of the history its not true because you already increased the total patients receiving this drug. Much more than 2% xxxxx I expect a huge increment in the prescription. I see the population has increased more than 2%. If I understand correctly, the increment in the patient pop receiving prod X is higher with the additional indication. Price will remain same with minor (5%) discount. If pop increase is by 70% there will be a significant discount

So lets look at that second expansion. They negotiate a 20% discount from 6,000, so weâ€™re at 4,800. And weâ€™re looking to go into that second expansion, so thatâ€™s into NSCLC, but only represents a 2% increase in the population. What price change would you expect with that, if its only a 2% increase. 
I see that the apparent increment in the population is not specifically high. But Iâ€™m not so convinced that the prescription will be increased by 10%. This is because the type of cancer is substantially more with the additional indication, and so the 2% is related only to lung cancer. This is irrelevant in my personal opinion. It is true, but it is not â€“ how can I say â€“ the end of the history. 2% for lung cancer but not 2% for the whole cancer population that will receive treatment. 
[Itâ€™s saying that if you look at everyone receiving treatment before expansion and everyone receiving treatment after indication expansion, the population that receives it only increases by 2%. ]
Ok, Iâ€™m sorry. I missed some boats. But the population has been already increased by the changes in indication. The first indication is a platform of 100 patient. The you change from 100 to 200. And then you further increase only by 2%. Therefore, the increment 2% - defined as 2% - is from one side absolutely correct. But at the end of the history its not true. Because you already increased the total number of patients that will receive this drug. And therefore the final increment is not 2% compared to time 0: its much more than 2%. Correct?
[Ok, so weâ€™re talking about it expanding a second time. So its already launched in A, B and gastric cancer, and if weâ€™re talking about its expansion into NSCLC.]
 Ok, its 2% compared to lung cancer; its not 2% compared to whole changes in indication. Its much more than 2%. 
[Ok, what % discount would you expect with that expansion.]
I expect an extension based on further oncologic indication that is as cited in the intermediator role plus 70% plus 60%. So, a huge increment, not a final, simple, irrelevant. In the case of a increment of 2%, the price substantially will remain the same. But I see the population is increased much more than 2% at the end of the history. If I understand in the correct manner the slide, the increment in the patient population that will receive drug X is higher with the additional indication. And so, if the final conclusion is that the patient population increases by 2%, this is irrelevant â€“ the price will remain the same  with a very, very minor discount. If the price is related to a population that is increased by 20%, in second line, the price will be reduced by AIFA.
[Just a quick clarifying question: when youâ€™re saying itâ€™ll all remain the same at a very minor discount, are you thinking a 5% discount, even less, what are you considering to be a very minor discount?]
In the case of 2%, its 5%. Modest change, very modest change. 5%",DAI475
17,176,"It was a lovely discussion. Obviously, as always, in the field of cancer, I am a researcher, and so the quality of the trials is not tremendously high. Therefore, it is difficult to negotiate the price with AIFA and with EMA, because they are seeing a lot of trials, statistical power probably low. But itâ€™s always the same history. In the field of cancer, the quality of the trials are very frequently, I have to say, even low. Acceptable, obviously, but substantially low. ",DAI475
18,1,"I think itâ€™s quite in line according to my information. One thing is to take into account this population which is stemming from epidemiological studies. Other thing is where we have to calculate the eligibility patients that are going to receive the new product which is obviously different. So, this is the maximum number of patients suffering from this condition HER2+. But, obviously we can assume that the product is going to take some market shares. This is the not the total number of patients that are going to receive the products, at least in the first years of the commercialization. So this is the only comment, but in principle these numbers are quite consistent.",DAI475
18,1.b,"It is the second calculation, because obviously as you know the driver variable in order to decide the price is the budget impact. So obviously the budget impact is represented by the expected population that is going to receive the products not the entire population suffering from this condition.

18,2.b,"Well, the main point/issue is the overall of survival which is not particularly high for this subgroup or population.

18,3.a,"4,4,2",DAI475
18,3.c.ii,"Because for the third line there are very few treatments. The length of the treatments is relatively short so at the end, the economic burden is definitely lower. If I remember correctly, we just have chemotherapies well Lonsurf is relatively expensive, but at the end if we compare the cost of treatment in the previous line with the 3rd and the following line there is quite a relevant difference in terms of burden. Obviously Iâ€™m thinking about pharmacological treatments because at this stage in any case I think hospitalizations are relatively rare there is no surgery there is no other aspects. So, I think that the pharmacological treatments are a good representation of the economic burden, which is not only related to this because we have visits, we have monitoring. But, the major costs are related for sure to the pharmacological treatments, which are if we take Irinotecan, Lonsurf, and the others, compared to the other lines is dramatically lower.",DAI475
18,4,2.5,DAI475
18,4.a,"Well, the limitation as I said in the beginning is consistent with the unmet need, so in any case the survival is not particularly high, so thatâ€™s why I wrote something in the middle. Even if, honestly speaking, when the question is level of satisfaction, it is more a question for clinicians than for economists. I tried to interpret the answer of a clinician, maybe they are more satisfied. You know the clinical perspective sometimes is quite different from the payers because clinicians might say they are quite satisfied particularly because they have in mind what happened years ago when some treatments were not available. So, compared to the past, I think we have quite a substantiable improvement. But still, I think there is a lot of room for improvement thatâ€™s why the satisfaction from my perspective is not very high. But again, a clinical could be in a position to give a better answer. ",DAI475
18,5.a,"4,4,5",DAI475
18,5.b,"Well, as far as I know for instance the safety and tolerability of these products are quite good. Obviously we may have some difference depending on the regiments that are chosen. But, I think that it is possible to improve. Obviously, the setting tolerability. But still I think that the major aspect is the quantitative aspect, so the number of months for survival thatâ€™s what I had in mind.

Well the difference is that for 3L we have quite fewer treatments compared to the 2L. In the 2L we have quite a lot of treatments, quite a lot of options really. So, I think to see the difference. But again, its very technical aspects because we may have different subpopulations, different status of patients, different response rates, so since we have quite a few alternatives I think it depends very much on the subgroup of patients that are going to be treated in the 2L particularly. Also the difference is maybe if the patients coming from the 1L or from other lines, you know the pathway of patients may interfere, may give different results because the sequence is very important, which is very difficult to evaluate now.",DAI475
18,10,"Obviously there is a major difference between Trial A and Trial B. It is not clear to me, are both Phase II but there are a lot of differences on the 2 studies. Just to understand, the Trial A is supportive, so the major trial is going to be Trial B, at least for the EMA, is that correct my interpretation? [Yes]
Also because even if (for instance) we have double the population in Trial A, it is only half the Asian population which is usually considered normally quite a strong limitation, in cancer. So, it is a difference opposite Trial B as US and European population. If I understand the positive aspect of Trial A is that it is a study vs a comparator. On the opposite product, Trial B, is a single-arm. It is quite a strange situation because normally a trial like Trial A could be considered more relevant. But according to the limitations of this trial probably is not the case. Even if apparently the results are expected to be very similar because looking to the mOS, it is exactly the same. Obviously Trial A is very useful to understand delta, the added benefit, which is roughly speaking 4 months. On the opposite it is impossible with a single arm. So thatâ€™s why probably we have to take into account both studies in order to understand the real benefits and confirming the 12 months of survival in trial B probably is the result we take into account, the mPFS is exactly the same . So yeah, I think, one is helping the other, if you like, the 2 trials. The impression is quite positive because, again if we take into account the irinotecan/paclitaxel, alternative, gaining roughly 4 months overall survival, itâ€™s an acceptable delta.",DAI475
18,11,"[Can assume follow on study in 2L] not clear to me, both phase II but there are a lot of difference between the 2 studies. Trial A is supportive, so trial B is the major trial for the EMA? [yes] Even if we have double the pop in trial A, its all Asian which is a strong limitation in cancer. If I understand, the positive of trial A is it's an RCT, but trial B is single arm which is quite a strange situation because normally a trial like A would be considered more relevant but according to limitations of Trial A its not the case. Results look to be very similar as mOS are the same. Trial A is important to understand the delta which is 4 months. On the other hand its a single arm which is why we have to take both into account. Confirming the mOS in trial B is what we will take into account. The 2 trials are helping each other. The case looks quite positive. Gaining 4 months more in survival in trial A is acceptable.",DAI475
18,11.b,I think itâ€™s acceptable because itâ€™s one of the alternatives now clinicians have in order to treat these patients so I think it is quite representative. Also for Italy I would say. No negative comments about that I would say.,DAI475
18,11.c,"I guess the only way to mitigate this kind of little concern, that normally in Italy we have when there is a single population, particularly in this case the Asian population, for whom sometimes in cancer there are some difficulties to consider how representative from biological points of view they are, not only from the biological POV but also from the healthcare organizations, there is still some concern about cancer from Asia that is why strongly we prefer studies with occidental countries. Ok some Asian country could be included, but not just Asian countries. The way to overcome this kind of limitation I guess is only one, to make a kind of ITC, and indirect treatment comparison. For instance, Iâ€™m sure that we have some good studies about the comparator that has been chosen for this Trial A. And indirectly, I have no data, but could be physical direct comparison just in order to confirm the results for instance. In here we have an mPFS over 3.5 months or survival or 8.5 just to check if the studies of the competitors in the test show the similar results. So the point is to be quite sure that the difference is not a major difference. Obviously we are talking about the comparator because X obviously the data are here. [In France, there could be an early access scheme for this 3L population, so there might be some real world data collected on outcomes from this French population and it would be in the 3L segment here. Would that data be valuable to you? It would be overall survival, time to discontinuation, QoL.]
Yes it is correct, I was wrong when I said that the only was an entire comparison through the registration of the clinical trials. Because helpfully if we have real world data from France, also this data could be taken into account in order to mitigate possibly the difference we have. So yes, just to say that the very sound decision is normally made on the clinical trials rather than real world studies, but in this case could be really supportive to give some results from France, absolutely.",DAI475
18,12.b,"Well, obviously itâ€™s not the best design as you may understand particularly because normally a single arm is well accepted, when there is no treatment alternative or we are talking about specific rare disease. But in this case, having already since years, Iâ€™d say, treatments for these patients, itâ€™s quite a limited design. But again, probably itâ€™s possible to combine the 2 results which are again very, very similar. So, I think in this case it could help. On the opposite, if the difference between the results form A and B would be very high we would have some problem obviously. But in this case maybe, I think it is going to be quite acceptable.",DAI475
18,12.b.i,"The comparator that has been used in Trial A, as I said, is quite acceptable honestly. So yeah. [moderator points out that Trial A is 3L and Trial B is 2L] Ah yes this is correct. Oh, well yes, because in 2L we have [thereâ€™s Ramucirumab and Pembrolizumab as an essential] which are quite different from the â€¦irinotecan. This is true, itâ€™s probably representing some problem because, yeah, sorry I didnâ€™t see that Trial A is a 3L+ and Trial B is 2L. Which was the rationale behind because having quite few well established treatments in 2L I think itâ€™s very difficult to give good rationale behind Trial B. This could be a problem because, for instance, if I look at these 2 trials, there is one problem. Assuming that the product is approved, because the results are positive, the point is, in which line are we going to approve this product, in 3L or 2L? You know because even if the population (blah blah) are very similar, have similar inclusion criteria, obviously the treatments for the patients was very different. One thing is to be a 3L another thing is to be in 2L. Probably this is the major problem that we are facing with these kind of studies because it is changing the label, itâ€™s changing the indication. So, how could it be possible based on Trial B to give 3L for instance? To just give just 2L, you know, if the results are very similar to the 3L it is not particularly positive. I think it is quite a strange situation because of differently, if the lines were the same, what I said until now could be quite reasonable. But now, realizing that the lines are different, there is a problem where to put this product in terms of indication. So again, could be possible for the Trial B to go through again in direct comparison, taking some of the problems that we just mentioned that are used in 2L. It seems at the end the final decision could be strongly based on indirect comparison rather than direct comparison.",DAI475
18,15,"[You mentioned the indirect comparison for Trial B, is there any other evidence or data that you would want to see for this product X?]

I think we have to work with the treatments that are available in the 2L. There is the major alternative that you mentioned before, you mentioned Cyramsza or Taxane, but you know, it is something to take into account because just the simplest picking, if this product is going to be approved in 2L the competitors are there. Now I donâ€™t know which were the results of this product in 2L, but it would make sense to put also product X in 2L if the results are relatively similar, fantastic could be if they are better. But if through the entire comparison it seems that maybe the results are lower, are less efficacious, could be very difficult to be approved in my opinion.",DAI475
18,16,"Could be minor improvement, could be moderate, could be significant. Breakthrough I exclude because the solidity is not very strong. Significant therapeutic improvement could be quite difficult but will depend on results of indirect therapeutic comparison.

Better, well it depends, for instance it could be minor therapeutic improvement could be but could be moderate, could be significant. Breakthrough innovation I exclude in any case because the solidity of this evidence apparently are not particularly strong so I would exclude breakthrough innovation. Significant therapeutic improvement could be either quite difficult, but between 1 and 3 it would depend very much on the results of the indirect comparison honestly. 
[Iâ€™m assuming it would depend on the overall survival benefit?]
Yes, absolutely.
[Is there a number that you think is an incremental benefit thatâ€™s more of a moderate improvement vs. a minor improvement. Are there numbers you are thinking about there?] 
Well for instance, minor could be, difficult to say because there isnâ€™t any threshold as you know. IFI is not applying a specific threshold, but I guess if we are talking about 2L, I donâ€™t know, 2 months of survival could be a minor for 5 (months) could be moderate maybe.",DAI475
18,16.c.i,"For the 3L again, the only evidence is for Trial A, but again there is some problem with Trial A. Even if because its more specific for 3L, we have 4 months, taking into account old caviats that A said about this trial, but maybe at that point could be relatively easier to be very close to 3 in this case.",DAI475
18,38,"Its because at EMA level they will know that there are confirming studies, ongoing, so just waiting for results, because at that point also for AIFA, it would be relatively easy to wait, to delay the negotiation in order to obtain this new data, that the EMA thinks that are coming, I donâ€™t know, in how many months approval, from European approval. Normally when there is a conditional approval for EMA, AIFA is waiting for the confirming studies. 
[So, even if it is EMA approved and it can be used, you think they would still wait for the confirmatory studies, they wouldnâ€™t evaluate it?]
Well the point is depending on how many months we would have to wait for the confirmation study. Because, if the point is to wait 6-8 months, it would make sense to delay the negotiation. If it is maybe longer could be maybe possible to be approved in some way even if it doesnâ€™t exist formally a conditional approval in Italy, but could be a kind of conditional approval where itâ€™s written that AIFA is in any case renegotiating the product at a certain time when the confirmation study would be available. That could probably be a typical situation for a product put in class CNN, which means that, when its CNN it is immediately available in the market, but is waiting for the final negotiation. This could be a compromise in some way. We have quite a few products staying 6 months, 8 months or so in class CNN, which is in principle not reimbursed because its (Class) C. But, itâ€™s waiting for the negotiation. This could probably be something, so in other words,  According to the EMA approval, AIFA could decide to give/open the market for the product but wait for the negotiation, which is the only way to give the full reimbursement 
[How long/what would the timing need to be before they saw the new data?]
There is a high variability, there are products in class CNN that waited one year or so, others just a few months. I would say it is case by case it is very difficult to preview particularly based on this data which could be the realurizon that you have to take into account. Again, the thing that would matter is the excepted results in terms of timing of the confirmation study, could be very crucial to understand. And based on this it would be possible to make some kind of forecast for how long the product would stay in class CNN.",DAI475
18,38.b,"I think that the 2L is more, is the more difficult indication because it is including a high number of patients. And again, the alternatives are quite a few. So it is the opposite, could be maybe possible to give first the 3L and waiting for some confirmation study, in order to give another indication also for the 2L. But you know its normally a product, unless we have specific subpopulations its difficult to obtain 2L, 3L, 4L at the same time. Normally, a product is approved for one line, then is following a negotiation for another line which is an extension, if you like. So, it depends on data. Could be possible to obtain also 1L and 2L, then the 3L, even if apparently, there is slight more solidity for the 3L, for the 2L. But again, they are so different these 2 studies, itâ€™s very difficult to choose which could be the study taken into account from AIFA in order to decide the first approval. Which could be, as we said depending on the direct comparison, particularly for the 2L, at that point, yeah, difficult to say, I have very few information. 
[Do you think if an indirection comparison was submitted, do you think that would be sufficient for reimbursement or do you think they would still wait for the follow-up study?]
I think according to these trials, I strongly think we would wait for confirming studies. 
[If the confirming study wasnâ€™t for over a year, would that change anything?]
Over a year it depends, we talking about 2 years? 
[Sure, letâ€™s say 2 years.]
Well, for 2 years obviously itâ€™s a lot. But the point is itâ€™s a lot why to give immediately, Product X to patients, if at the end the solidity of this trial is not particularly high, because there are alternatives for 3L, but as well particularly for the 2L, there are alternatives. So, the so-called unmet need in terms of availability of treatments is not particularly high. The unmet need is high because the disease as we said, but is not so high because there are no treatments. So, the only situation where it could be possible to go straight on to the approval, could be, but is not the case, in a situation where there is a lack of treatments. So, even if the solidity of the evidence is not high in any case, we can take the risk and we give the patient the treatments. But, this is not the case apparently. 
[Do you think it would be reimbursed in 3L, but they would wait in 2L for the additional data?]
Probably yes.",DAI475
18,40.a,"In 3L, once itâ€™s possible to check the solidity of this 4 months incremental mOS, there is a room in order to be considered innovative probably. But again, yes itâ€™s possible, maybe a conditional innovation which is a little bit lower, but still innovative. There is not much difference between  conditional innovative status and full innovative status honestly, but could be because in 3L the unmet need is quite high. If confirmed, this delta could be considered quite good. Obviously the quality of the studies could be very low, but in many cases was not  3rd criteria which is the quality of the study, in many cases this was not a reason to not give the conditional innovation status. So, in principal itâ€™s possible to be considered innovative, itâ€™s a matter of analysis of data. So even if my impression is that this product at the moment is not providing particularly solid evidence but maybe going through the real data of the trial maybe it could be possible to have this kind of outcome of this assessment.",DAI475
18,69,"As correctly you provided in the material, I think itâ€™s [slide 7] which was very helpful for me, was a good synthesis. According to the relatively short duration of the treatment, what matters is not the cost per month, but the expected cost per course. Here, correctly is well represented, so there is the cost per month, but what matters is the cost per course. 

opdivo, cyramza - old products? So many indications in last years. 60% discount never happens for new products. It's the case for these old, widely used treatments in oncology. Lonsurf had 40% discount which is quite good for a new prod as normally 30%. I would say for prod X starting at 30%. 60-40% are very high calculation discounts because these products are nuanced",DAI475
18,69.b,"opdivo, cyramza - old products? So many indications in last years. 60% discount never happens for new products. It's the case for these old, widely used treatments in oncology.

I would say for prod X starting at 30%. 60-40% are very high calculation discounts because these products are nuanced",DAI475
18,70,"Yeah, the 60% obviously is because the first PDL1 products, Opdivo/Keytruda are, we can say, almost quite old products, so they receive the following discounting during the life of the product. Because, as you know, Opdivo/Keytruda, they had so many indications in the last years, just to say that a 60% discount never happened for a new product. This is a specific case of this quite old and established and largely-used in oncology products. Otherwise, well also, Lonsurf had quite a few indications, thatâ€™s why 40%, which is a reasonable discount. Normally for a brand new product itâ€™s around 30%, but again, it depends what is the list price that the company is asking for. But, I would say for Product X something around 30%, even if I donâ€™t know which is going to be the requesting price. But 60/40, are definitely high confidential discount because these products are quite specific. 
[I know you said its CNN, is that just for 2L or is that overall? What happens if its reimbursed in 3L but has CNN in 2L, how does that work?]
Yes, looking at these 2 different lines, it depends how I would consider the evidence for 3L or the evidence for the 2L. The point is that the company has to make an application and asking for which kind of line is thinking for the products. So, it would depend which is the request. If the company asks first for 3L, could be probably CNN for 3L, on the opposite also for the 2L. To ask simultaneously for the two lines would be, well, very difficult I think. But even so, would be possible to have CNN for both lines. Thinking about just a single product. So, I donâ€™t think there is a distinction between the lines having CNN. CNN is something, I donâ€™t say automatic, but almost, because when a product is approved by EMA, the company may ask for CNN class. So, may ask to be commercialized immediately because the registration is mandatory from the European agency. And, is in this list of products are waiting for the negotiation. Normally a CNN is asked for when also the company knows that itâ€™s not possible to go straight on for the negotiation. So the point is, a company may ask not for CNN, but ask for the negotiation. The risk is if its not a CNN, itâ€™s not commercialized and we are waiting for price reimbursement. So, normally when there is this kind of lack of evidence, conditional approvals, waiting for more evidence and the company knows obviously the studies are ongoing, the good choice is CNN because the product is immediately available even if it is not reimbursed. But, as you know we are talking about hospital products, so the reimbursement in some way is a kind of reputation of the product. In principal, one hospital is able to buy even a product in class CNN which could be the case maybe for some patients in 2/3L, they will start to try the product, even if itâ€™s not reimbursed because itâ€™s a matter of hospital budget at the end. Itâ€™s not like outpatient products that if they are Class C or CNN, the patient has to pay out of pocket. In this case at hospital level, the patient has to pay nothing if the hospital is giving the availability of this product. So, itâ€™s a matter of volume probably because Iâ€™m sure in some hospitals, some clinicians will ask the department to by some dosage of the product, even if at the regional level they may say that there is no reimbursement, which means normally this expensive products in oncology are directly financed by the regional authority. A CNN must be on charge on the hospital budget without the possibility to ask the regional authority to give the funding. So, itâ€™s a matter of financial aspects. For sure, a CNN is having quite normally low volume during the CNN classification. 
[So, If itâ€™s the CNN class negotiation, is there a price negotiation for this product?]
No, no, CNN is free price. Normally the price of a product in CNN is assumed to be the price that the company is going to ask for in the following negotiation normally. Could be quite odd to start with a price in CNN then to ask for a strongly different price when we will have months later the negotiation. But its not based on negotiation, because itâ€™s class C.",DAI475
18,73,"[xxxx CNN] depends on the 2 different line - depends how AIFa considers it, whether the evidence for 2L or 3L is considered more solid. The company has to make an application and asking for what kind of line they request for the product. If the company request 3L, then CNN for 3L, same for 2L. If ask for the 2L at the same time then quite difficult but possible to have CNN for both. I don't think there is a distinciton between lines having CNN. When a product is approved by EMA, the company may ask for CNN class. MAy ask to be commercialised immediately because registration mandatory for EMA. Normally a CNN is asked for when the company also knows it's not possible to go straight on for the negotiation. The point is, a company may ask not for CNN but asking for negotiation. Risk is, if not CNN, not commercialised and waiting for price for reimbursement. Usually when there is lack of evidence, conditional approval, the good choice is CNN because prod is immediately available even if not reimbursed. Reimbursed in a way is to do with reputation of the product. A hospital can buy a product in class CNN which may be the case for some patients in some hospitals. They will try first the product because hospital dependent. The patient doesnt have to pay out of pocket if the hospital giving the product. Matter of volume. Some hospitals will ask to buy some dosage of the product even if at regional level no reimbursement. These prods normally reimbursed at the regional level. CNN must be in charge xxx it's a matter of financial aspects. CNN normally has low volume during classification. [price negotiation if CNN?] No, CNN is free price. Normally the price in CNN is assumed to be the price the company will ask in the following negotiation. It would be odd to start with a price in CNN then ask for a different price when we undergo negotiations",DAI475
18,81.c,"I think yes (innovative), consistency with the efficacy data. Safety data quite good, seems even better than Ram/pac. Trial C is encouraging. With this data no doubt about approval and likely to be considered innovative [seems for this prod could seek reimburseement in 3L then follow up with trial C in 2L or seek CNN and xxx] Yes, possibility, according to eval of trial A and the FR evidence in 3L, at that point possible 3L indication will be negotiated with a price with the indication. Waiting for trial C to have extension to 2L. Pathway could be reimbusement in 2L as well, not a point of CNN. CNN could be used to go directly to market but just a matter or months xxx 3L follow the normal way for negotiation, once trial C, normal pathway for 2L. Knowing there is trial C is a reason to stop intiial negotiation for trial B. xxxx irinotecan and paclitaxel in terms of comparator so could be a... difficult situation because if prod starts in 3L, the price per course in 3L is relatively low compared to the majority of 2L. I dont know how convenient for company to start with 3L. xxx could increase price but delicate. Could be quite difficult to obtain prices more likely to be recorded for 2L. I would wait for trial C, go straight into 2L then extension to 3L might be easier [if you did launch just in 3L the ref is pacli or iri which you are noting as low price, would you reference per course?] the number of lines of treatment could be longer than comparator as PFS is better. Could be possible to take cost per month even if cost per course increased - maybe 3000 a month + premium. xxx assume this prod better than comparator. Premium could be in terms of price per month and if longer duration of treatmentxxx stay with price per month. [what would be the price per month compared to pacli?] 2x or 3x because good improvement and economic comparator cheap. [If the prod waited for 2L data, and launched and had first negotiation with 2L or later pop I'm assuming cymramxa and ccc would be comparators? So price per month is 4,400 and per course it's 25,000, what could prod x?] starting point but according to better outcomes, premium of 20% or more [price per month or per course?] in this case the real reference is price per course because impacts the budget but I think we have a few months more treatment compared to cymramza. Taking price per month could be good in this case [in price renegotiations (indi expansion) could the prod increase price?] no, this has never happened. Once a prod has a price, we only expect price reduction not a price increase. Possible in some diseases where not a case of xxx since talking about different lines for same disease, extension would mean price reduction. Not subtantial as the number of patients in 3L not so high and budget impact not so high. Minor discount but must be expected",DAI475
18,83.a,"Well we are talking about 2L, there is is a good comparator, because itâ€™s one of the alternatives. The number of patients is good, is international, itâ€™s Phase 3. So, ok thatâ€™s a good study apparently, absolutely. We have the PFS, is on the edge, but itâ€™s acceptable, we have less than 5 months. But yes, I think that with this study actually, the outcome of AIFA would be absolutely positive, yes.
[What do you think the innovation status might be?]
Well, yes, I think so because the length of months again is quite consistent. There is also a consistency with the PFS and the response rate. Safety data, just to understand, yes, are quite good because it seems even better than ramucirumab, paclitaxel. So yes, I think this Trial C is encouraging, absolutely yes. With this data I think no doubt about approval and quite likely to be considered innovative, absolutely. 
[So it seems like the 2 scenarios for this product, it could try to seek reimbursement only for 3L and then follow along and try to seek reimbursement 2L, or it could go for CNN with 2L later originally, am I understanding that appropriately?]
Just a second, I come back to the initial studies. So, we have the Asian study, if I understand, asking for, well, that could be a possibility. Could be even to according to the evaluation of Trial A and if Iâ€™m right, the French evidence are for the 3L, correct?
[Yes]
At that point could be possible that the 3L indication is going to negotiated normally with a price with indication and waiting for Trial C, when it will be available, in order to have the extension to 2L,yes. A reasonable pathway could be, first of all, to obtain a reimbursement in 3L. So its not a matter of CNN honestly, well CNN is something to go immediately into the market, but itâ€™s just a matter of months to be negotiated, which is normal. When a product is approved by EMA itâ€™s not immediately negotiated in Italy, we have to wait months in any case. So, I would say 3L following the normal way for the negotiation. Once there is trial C, a normal pathway for negotiation, price reimbursement for 2L, according to the evidence coming from Trial C. Could be, knowing that there is a Trial C, for me, is a reason to stop the initial negotiation for the 2L. So, a good sequence would be first of all approval for 3L, then when there is Trial C, again, the company would ask for a new negotiation because itâ€™s an extension. So, as you know, every indication is a new negotiation. And we will have the negotiation for 2L, yeah, that could be reasonable yeah.",DAI475
18,85.b,"[So, just focusing for 3L at first, what would you think would be an appropriate price reference for Product X in 3L?]
Well, you know in principle, which is driving is the comparator in this case we are talking about irinotican/paclitaxel in terms of comparators. So could be, you know there is quite a difficult situation because if the product starts in 3L, the price per course in the 3L is relatively low compared to the 2L, the majority of the 2L. So, I donâ€™t know how convenient it could for the company it would be to start 3L, because once there is a price, if with Trial C, we will have a second negotiation for the 2L, it would be possible to increase the price. So, itâ€™s a delicate aspect. I donâ€™t say that the price for X could be exactly the price for irinotecan or Lonsurf, because its making improvements so a premium price could be there. But, could be quite difficult to obtain a price that is more likely according for the 2L, so honestly from a strategical point of view, I would wait for the Trial C, going straight on to the 2L then the extension of 3L could be relatively easier. 
[So, would you reference the price per course for these products?]
Yes, good question. Because probably the number of months of treatment with X could be longer than with the comparator because Product X is better, right. But, well, could be for the 3L could be possible to take the cost per month, even if the cost per course would be increased. But it would make sense to take the price per month in this case, thinking about 3000 euros with a premium. Even if the course maybe could be double than we have here, could be reasonable. Some calculation must be made, but we assume this Product is better than comparators so a premium could be given in principle in terms of price per month. If in this case, we have a few months of longer treatments, according to the numbers, it doesnâ€™t affect particularly the decision. So, I think that they will stay with the price per month honestly. 
[What do you think the price per month premium could be?]
In this case, these products are relatively cheap, if you like. So, according to this incremental could be expected even double or even 3 times because we have quite a good improvement. Again, because the economic comparators are relatively cheap. 
[Letâ€™s think about if product waited until the 2L data was available and launched and had their very first price negotiation with this 2L+ population. So, in that case Iâ€™m assuming price reference would be again the trial comparator for this follow on study? Is that correct?]
Yes, correct. Thatâ€™s why the price of X could be definitely higher than if its approved first for the 3L.
[So the price per month is around 4500 and price per course is around 25000. What do you think product X could achieve in terms of its price point?]
Oh, that could be a starting point, but again, according to the better benefit Iâ€™m sure that a premium could be applied, 20% maybe, or even more.
[Do you think they look at price per month or price per course?]
In this case, the real reference is the price per course because this is the impact on the budget obviously. But, I think we have a few more months of treatment compares to Cymraza. So I think a good start could be taking the price per month in this case. 
[In price renegotiations if the product comes back, is it ever possible that the product increases their price?]
No, this has never happened. As I said at the beginning, once the product has a price, we can only expect a price reduction, but never a price increase. Could be possible in some diseases where itâ€™s not a matter of lives, but itâ€™s a matter of indication, so you have different indications so itâ€™s possible sometimes to apply a price, indication based. But in this case, since we are just talking about the different lines for the same disease, once there is a price, an extension is a price reduction for sure. Maybe not substantial, because probably the budget impact would not be so big because the number of patients in 3L would not be particularly high, it depends on the estimation of the budget impact. But some discount is to be expected, maybe a minor discount, but must be expected.",DAI475

18,100,"So this is again also a 2L, but obviously a different tumor. We have 2 trials again, but are both single arm. Well, the exclusion criteria are quite different from the 2. So, they are for 2 different doses?
[Thereâ€™s 2 trials because there were different doses and they were determining which dose they were going to submit to EMA approval.]
So, at the end the focus would be on Trial 2 only. Ok, so yes I think its, again also in this case, Iâ€™m not able to evaluate this 16 months OS, these 7 months PFS because itâ€™s a single arm. So, we have quite the alternatives in mNSCLC, but not too many for the 2L honestly. So again, in this case itâ€™s a better situation than before, because we have to focus for price reimbursement on Trial 2. And what I said about the others its similar because being a single-arm, first of all could be of interest to understand the rationale behind why the company did this, because itâ€™s a Phase 2, but itâ€™s also in this case waiting for a Phase 3 double arm or not?
[Letâ€™s say thereâ€™s not going to be a Phase 3 in this 2L population.]
Ok, so the negotiation would be based on this study only. Because in 2L we have quite few alternatives really, we have PDL1, we have other products. Which make particularly here itâ€™s a little bit more crowded situation, the 2L for mNSCLC. So again we come back to the need for an indirect comparison. Again, with all weaknesses we showed before for X in gastric cancer, even if here there is just one study, so there is no difficulty that we had before. One study, not 2 because Trial 1 is only for safety, and there is no difficulty we had before with 2 different lines. This 2L, very clear the indication. So, the point is to understand, if itâ€™s the case to approve a product in mNSCLC based on a single-arm, which is quite unusual honestly. Could be maybe that some products have been approved, but normally, in this space, we need a double arm study. But again, could be a matter of results, honestly I donâ€™t know. Apparently these 6 months of survival in 2L are I donâ€™t know, if are very good or not honesty. If AIFA, apparently theyâ€™re not terrific, but the point is, knowing that there is no any Phase 3 coming in the future, would be in the position to approve this product or not. Again, the evaluation would be based on the solidity of this data, take into account the ITC, otherwise there is no chance.
[If there is an ITC presented, do you think Product X would be reimbursed by AIFA with a single-arm and if they did submit a direct comparison as well? Recently Goverecto was approved in November, with a single-arm.]
According to this previous place, In which indication?
[Goverecto, I donâ€™t have the indication]
Because you know the indication makes a difference, it depends on the comparator, it depends on the unmet need, it depends on the delta that is coming from the indirect comparison. You mentioned a good example, so in principle itâ€™s possible to approval product based on a single arm study. If the comparison is quite convincing, yes, there is a possibility. In this case for NSLCLC, its easier than the previous because itâ€™s just one shot, if you like. So with this study there is a negotiation and we see there is no reason for waiting, or delaying the negotiation. Because, if I understand the only evidence the company is going to provide is this phase 2 study. So this could be AIFA deciding if this evidence is enough as it was for the product that you mentioned has been approved recently in another space with a single arm. So potential its possible, absolutely.
[If it was reimbursed, what price do you think would be the reference price for Product X in mNSCLC?]
I think we have to come back to the treatments that we have in this space. So, at slide 14, there is quite a strong difference in terms of class of drugs. Obviously if we take chemo its very cheap, the opposite, the immunooncologic therapies are relatively expensive. But again, what matters could be the indirect comparison with some of these products at least. Depending which is considered the best indirectly compared product, we take naturally the cost of the comparator. So, if the comparator is Pembro, we start with the price of Pembro. Obviously different regiments, so the point is to understand the type of patients, because they are relatively different, right, because the indications are quite different of this class of drugs. So, we have to find as the indication of X, compared with some of these products, because these products are given to different patients in principle.  
[So the indirect treatment comparison would show product X is better than a lot of these agents. Do you have any thoughts on what price AIFA would look to negotiate?]
No honestly, I have no clear in mind which could be the population that would be treated with X compared to the population that would be treated with the best comparator. Because populations relatively different, are patients coming from different previous treatments, there is also the histology that is different. There is also patients already having chemo or not. Itâ€™s the positioning of the product X, according to so many treatments in 2L, its quite difficult. That could be the effort to be done, to decide according to the data, that product X is reimbursed for a certain population and looking which are the products that are currently used for this similar/same population. Automatically, we will have a reference price. Obviously there is quite a strong difference between immunotherapies in these regiments. So try to understand if we are more close to immunotherapies or GBF regiment, itâ€™s a matter of indication I would say, indication which means the population of the study. 
[Do you think they would reference price per course or the price per month?]

In principle for this kind of patients, according to the lines, according to the disease, normally again, the budget impact is based on cost per course obviously. But, if there is no major difference in terms of duration of the treatment. Which could probably not be much different because the PFS is 7 months, I donâ€™t think we are very far from the PFS of some current products. So, at the end could be quite reasonable to take also in this case a price per month.",DAI475

18,156,[price per course or month?] budget impact based on cost per course but if no major difference in terms of duration of treatment which would not be so different as PFS is 7months which is not so different from other products so could take price per month I think.,DAI475
18,157,"It depends on timing. You mean that this Phase 3, Phase 2 in 1L is coming later?
[Yes]
Oh yes, the impact would be, as I said before, I assume that Product X is reimbursed in 2L. Then, when there is the availability of the 1L clinical trial, we are facing as usual an extension. So, yes we will have a new negotiation referred to the 1L indication. As it happens normally, as I said, we will have some discount, because the population that is going to be treated with X could be higher than before. Very normal situation, I think it would be easier to negotiation 1L, because at that point we will have a double arm on a study. So yes, if this 1L study comes before the 2L could be probably better because the evidence could be more solid. But, no problem if later on we have the 1L extension, we will have a normal negotiation because itâ€™s a new indication. So yeah, I donâ€™t see any specific, yeah, could be very easy.",DAI475
18,164,"[What kind of price change would you expect with this indication expansion of 2% in population?]
Well, with the 2% extension of population, the discount could be absolutely negligible. We have to take the experience of Diva, the X factor remained the same for a long period and the discounts were somewhat proportional to the increase in population. If we are talking about 2% of population, would be difficult to maintain the net price because in any case there is an increase in expenditure. Different, is talking about 10% increasing of the population, at this point the discount could be a little bit higher, but yes I donâ€™t think it could be a major problem, no. 
[If the total treatment does increase around 10%, what type of percent change are you expecting for the price at that point?]

Difficult to say, because normally 10% population doesnâ€™t mean 10% discount, because the point is to understand the total value that we are talking about. If the 10% is applied to 1000 patients, its different than if 10% is applied to 3000 patients, as you may understand. So, in the second case, obviously the discount could be higher because we have a lot more patients than in the first case. But, in principal there is no specific rule. Itâ€™s a compromise because in any case, assuming that Product X is considered better than the comparators, that we have seen at least in these 2 indications, in any case we are willing to pay for an incremental expenditure for X. The discount is just to contain as much as possible the increasing expenditure, which could be that in any case. Just to say, it is not that the confidential discount must be so high in order to change the budget impact could be positive for sure. The point is to reduce a little bit the delta thatâ€™s why itâ€™s difficult to say if 10% population higher, means 5%, 10%, 15% discount. Itâ€™s difficult to say, it depends on the total number of patients. And obviously the cost per course. I get that yes, for instance in NSCLC the duration of treatment is apparently longer than the duration of treatment in gastric, we have to take this into account. Once there is the price, at that point what matters is the average cost per patients that we may have in gastric added to the previous indication than in lung cancer considering in the previous indication. So, the calculation must be made having the data. But some discount would be there, but difficult to preview it would be very high. Again, 2% population could be absolutely limited, 10% could be something more but I donâ€™t know. 

Again, the situation for NSCLC is apparently easier than in gastric, but some aspects are very similar for Product X in both indications because the solidity is not very strong. Apart from the study C we are expecting in gastric, which could be a normal way for price reimbursement. Obviously I donâ€™t know which could be the influence on the previous indication that could positively maybe influence the extension to gastric and to lung cancer. Just to say that itâ€™s not a new trial to understand which are the current/previous indications of Product X, because they could influence the following indications.",DAI475
18,176,The situation for NSCLC is slightly easier than for GC due to the problems I tried to underline. Some of the scenarios are similar. Study C in gastric could offer a normal way for pricing and reimbursement. It's not a new trial to understand which are the previous indications as could also influence following indications,DAI475
19,1,We don't have any information about metastatic HER2+ GC or what the standard of care is. I did some research in various guidelines but there's no specific information about this subgroup of HER2+ mGC. 20% of gastric tumours are HER2+ but it seems you have more granular information especially for 3L+ treatmnents. This question is more for clinicians and not so much for HTA people or regulators.,DAI475
19,1.b,"[Do you focus on market share or eligible?] both but we focus more on label indications and then any subgroup analysis to understand which group of patients have better benefit. Overall pop is part of the picture but we need to see specifically the line in order to understand the total amount of patients which is totally moved based on the guidelines. We have HER2+ using trastuzumab and the other part id PDL1. The 2L and 3L will be based on these two groups. If we have information on this from the trials it will help us to understand. Then combinations in 2L with cyramza or not, patients with contraindications for chemo, taxanes and other drugs. These are the considerations to know. Linking with the last slide on strategy is important to know at the beginning so oyu know the estimated number to treat and the price definitions will take into consideration the indications. My suggestion here is to focus on the overall number of patients to treat with this drug.

We have registries and we have mandatory data collection as part of old negotiations with the manufacturer of cyramza. We collect this data and the registries were important when drug launched because they implement cost sharing agreement. More or less what you report in price discussions. Cyramza is available and used 2L, reimbursed by national health service. This is in line with IT guidelines. [thoughts on 3L?] no indications in the guidelines. If we have specification for the 1L treatment (HER2+ adenocarcinoma), use of trastuzumab after chemo. We also have considerations for the 2L and subsequent therapies depends on prior therapy and patient status. Choice of therapy does not depend on tumour HER2 overexpression status except for trastuzumab deruxtecan it's launched and has data on this tumour. Target therapy may be indicated for patients with microsatellite instability, mismatch repair deficient. Excluding cyramza + pacli which is 2L therapy and monotherapy for patients with disease progression after 1L platinum or fluorothyrimidine containing therapy, the consideration is taking into account monotherapy with pacli etc. what you report here.

19,10,"conjugate antibody drug, B will be fundamental as pivotal, so important for registration of this indication. Ph2 open label single arm so concerns about robustness. This is not a rare disease so it's not the setting to have a single arm trial. Cyramza was orphan drug designated, is this the same for product X? Cyramza was orphan deisgnation but in 2014 so we have to check because that can justify evidence with single arm trial. The orphan designation can also explain this for the payer perspective. I miss here some other information, for example what is the duration of response in these trials? This can complete for my side the evaluations in terms of the level of therapeutic improvement, clinical improvement or added value. We look at all this information here. For trial A, it's open label - can be justified as control arm is physician's choice. Is this drug oral or injection? [IV] so this could be, it's active controlled. The problem we have here is Asian population. In terms of pathophysiology of gastric cancer, if we know no variability between caucasian and Asian patients, I don't know. The drug is the same for NSCLC, and for this, for oncogenic addicted (egfr or braf mutations), we know we have variability from a clinical perspective. This the company have to explain very well why they use Asian population. So, what are the pros and cons here, for both I miss duration of response as it can support ORR as this is a surrogate endpoint. [Overall survival is a key secondary endpoint, as is PFS, is it sufficient?] yes, but you have a problem with your trial design because this is a single arm and this is a phase II, so you dont have a comparative exercise. I can say this is 12 months, it's a good one. I can update the ranking here, I'm in the middle or low and moderate for trial B. I need duration of response to complete the picture. The elements of safety are okay. What is the impact on QoL? [assume data on QoL would be collected in these trials] do you have an improvement or maintenance? [What would you like to see?] an assessment of QoL as secondary outcome and to show an improvement, not just a positive trend. The third one is regarding safety. Do you have more than 30% 3/4 toxicity that impacts daily wellbeing? All these questions relevant. Including daily wellbeing includes alopecia, nausea etc. to assess toxicity and tolerability. This assessment and ORR which is primary EP. This is a non-curative setting, so maximum rating is 3, moderate. On trial A, this is supportive. You have the problem of Asian pop. Have physician's choice and you have always surrogate as primary endpoint. [do you think comparator in trial A appropriate?] Yes, I think so. I understand we dont have a comparator in 2L. This irinotecan and pacli is what we mentioned before as recommendations for 2L. [Trial A in 3L, ESMO recommend Lonsurf or irino / pacli as 3L options] maybe here the considerations is physicians choice more appropriate for 2L because in the 3L we have trifluridine.",DAI475

19,38,"We are considering now without other elements [in terms of the other trial you looked at - Trial C, we know it's ongoing but we don't have any data on it yet. Not sure if there will be a conditional assessment but let's assume we have trial A and B and C is ongoing] trial A is supportive B is pivotal. I think also in this case, the possibility from reg perspective could be conditional authorisation. From AIFA perspective, I think they will accept more the 2L trial with the uncertainties that will be there with regulatory sides with post approval efficacy data or any other incoming information. Given that the unmet need is quite high, they can expect to reimburse. [If the EMA label was 2L+, what would you expect?] to restrict the populations [why not reimbursed in 3L?] I think the EMA label could be broader to 2L+, AIFA can restrict the indication but we need to see in more detail the design of the trial and also to see a bit more the characterisation of European populations in this trial. I think the assessment will first focus on unmet need which is high and then the details of the trial, specifically trial B which is pivotal. [EMA is 2L or later but you expect reimbursement only in 2L and not 3L, why not 3L?] the physician's choice doesnt match clinical guidelines [per the ESMO clinical guidelines, options are lonsurf, taxane, pacli or irino] but I don't see any contraindications for antiandrogenic therapy. In aGC, for the 2L treatment we have 4 categories [I'm talking about 3L, the Asian pop where you expect no reimbursement, you are saying physician's choice not appropriate?] for the 3L you have the possibility of oral therapy, what we mentioned before about fluridine or physicians's choice. The concern is maybe not specifically physician's choice but what are the inclusion exclusion criteria to use physician's choice and not an active comparator that is reimbursed and is known given the toxicity profile of this drug. This population is Asian population and doesn't represent Italian population. Do we have variability for gastric cancer, differences between Asian and caucasian populations? If for example there was an explanation in the European public assessment report on pops in the trial, I don't know if 100% Asian or...[you can assume 100% Asian] then this is a concern. This can stop the assessment and they would like to see data from a caucasian population. This is nothing new, this conjugate we had the same situation in the breast cancer. I know why these trials have this population. [what do you mean in breast cancer?] we had this consideration in a previous assessment. If you remember NSCLC gefitinib, the trial was based on Asian pop and it's antivascular growth, I don't remember the exact biomarker but the problem with the trial was linked to enrollment of patients in Asia. This is not an issue in HTA but clinical, need to include data on characterisation of the disease and factors which can affect efficacy. [FR RWE data] this can support regulatory dossier and if data able to support that we dont have an issue accepting what EMA is reporting in the public assessment. The Asian pops are more affected in this disease - abnormalities in the subtypes. For genomic classifications, we know in the Asian cancer genome subtyping there is some overlap. There are 4 subytepes of gastric cancer expressed. We have to understand the biology, is the biology different from European population? [sounds like riembursement in 2L is likely and potentially in 3L with additional FR RWE in a Western pop, what innovation status?]  if we accept this as orphan indication then we will accept the single arm, in terms of unmet need the situation is quite clear as we don't have drugs. The add value is more focussed on primary EP and also safety. In this case, if we only have this drug coming in the setting we can think about the potential innovation status [What if not orphan status?] Not possible. I mentioned evntual potential, not sure as the ORR is not... I would like to see something like 60% [do you look at objective response or OS?] objective response. [If not orphan would it be reimbursed at all?] For reimbursement, the unmet need is high and disease context with it being a severe cancer without many alternatives and not many biomarkers. Based on trial B, some indirect treatment comparisons could be important. The problem here is the evidence as the evidence is low. Difficult to do an assessment in this case, Potential innovation given high unmet need is a possibility of this scenario.",DAI475

[For this drug, if reimbursed in 2L and potnetially 3L given FR RWE in 3L, what would be the appropriate price reference?] you report in slide 19 some exhibit [those are some potential prices but if you want to see prices of available products its price 7] Consdiering that you report information here on net price, I think you have to increase this discount here because 40% was different years ago for cyramza and pembro. [If not 60 and 40% discount, what do you expect?] 40% was 10 years ago and each negotiation we have an erosion of at least 10%.

I suggest to launch in the same time [delay luanch until trial C?] yes, try to do something better in terms of trial design. I dont think any change in terms of pricing. if launching 1 or 2 years after intial launch then maybe because they would like to see more data from the clinical setting. [You can launch with A and B and you might get a price, but when trial C becomes available have to renegotiate. Or delay and launch with trial C, is there a way to be reimbursed at first conditional upon trial C coming if trial C coming quite soon to delay until data available?] delay not possible if you submit the pricing and reimbursement dossier. Have a process of negotiations, can anticipate trial C if you know its coming in a few motnhs. You can anticipate to AIFA your protocol design and what you are doing and they can consider the eventual extensions of indications. This formula of burdget cap or financial based agreements are acceptable in these situations. If I know from the beginning I have extensions or new trials, this is a sort of risk sharing AIFA for national helath service and company also. This formula makes sense and has worked well in the past and now. I said before not to wait because I have concerns on trial A and B, if you have a good indirect analysis you can obtain an acceptable price, but trial C gives more price on this. If difference is 3-6 months makes sense to wait and submit a compelet dossier with trial C. If for exmplae you have a price with trial B then trial C comes in a year, I dont think any change on pricing. Very short time for pricing as we need at least 2 years to reassess. As single arm trial, uncerttainty high, sometimes, in that situation, can accept potential innovation because high unmet need and another trial incoming, I can decide that the innovation status has a validity of not 3 years but 1 year. We don't have clear rules on this because sometimes advanceed therapy e.g. CART therapy they obtain full innovations but validity is 1 year, so reassessment because new data incoming but the validity of pricing is 2 years. Very complicated to say is the price changing? Not changing after reassessment, but the financial agreements were based on outcomes, but these agreements can handle very well these situations [If the manufacturer did wait and submit when trial C was available and submitted together, does that change price expectations for prod X?] always do these assumptions, if there's a drug - assuming first one, unique without any other indication I think yes, the price expectation can change [before you said 2.8 -3K does that change?] yes, I mean + 1 or 2K, so 5K because you are the first one and no other indications.

These trials are single arm trials which I understand. ORR is the primary endpoint but this is interesting in terms of value. OS data, 16 months. Duration of response is 9 months. Same problem in terms of trial 2 is more supportive for these indications. Trial 1 is just supportive for safety data seems to me from this slide [efficacy data would be collected for trial 1, it does have a diffrernt dosing and trial 2 is the dosing that would be approved and recommended by the EMA, would you still want to see trial results for trial 1>] Different characterisation here, relapsed after refractory to SoC instead of disease progression after 1 prior systemic chemo including platinum. Trial 2 more complete in terms of label definitions. Trial 1 is braoder, SoC generally speaking. These data are important to support safety data when you have to define safety profile you need a pooled analysis as just 1 trial not enoguh, especially not with a single arm trial. The final table of efficacy is based on trial 2. 60% ORR is the limit. We need to see more than 60% in terms to have at keast a moderate clinical benefit. Another consideration different to gastric is, what is the application here? Gastric, cyramza was orphan, in this case, this is not a rare disease. Maybe there are difficulties in enrolling patients with this disease, I don't know. This is a problem in terms of understanding the efficacy data and this trial. [so you need strong rationale for why not comparative trial?] yes [what do you think is a strong rationale?] I want to understand in order to assess the innovation. We start innovation with 3 criteria, assuming unmet need, added value that are linked with things on the slide but the 3rd criteria on robustness of clinical evidence, I can do RCT, I can do double blind, I can do open label, I can do single arm as rare disease and no comparaotor. That's my thought process in understanding and assessing these trials. What is the % of HER2+ cancers in NSCLC [very small, 5% at most] this is outside the context of our discussion but in Europe we have the revisions of regulations of orphan medicinal products and in these discussions we are touching arguments that some cancer indications with evolutions of biomarkers are evolving the algorithm of the treatment but we have small populations in well-known diseases that are not orphan diseases, but these small populations we can consider as orphan indications, orphan populations. Complicated discussion but from reg perspective, not orphan indications but when speaking to payers have to consider as an orphan designation, This can accept single arm trial.

We can calculate with this expansion the increase in pop and do weighted average but how would an IT payer look at this and decide how price will evolve?] It's easier. First, the B indication and the gastric, if they obtain innovations or not changes the situation. If fully innovative then you have more power in negotiations. If not considering innovation here [it sounds like the price is based on incrememntal budget impact or the total population size. Is it based on total pop size e.g. 300 people more, or % increase?] they look at both - absolute numbers and percentage but no formula on this as they have to base price impact and what is the price of the drug in general and disease setting? They have to align price based on value. Which are the best drugs we have in general, we have drugs that are game changers e,g, pembro or nivo, so that's the gold stnadard, You can have particular categories. Many indications, the exercise will be price volume concept or budget cap. I have to see the size of the target pop and I can put thresholds to include discount for pharmacists and clinical practice. difficult to have exact percentage and see differentiation. I dont think helpful to say what could be expected prices based on indication expansion.

I'm thinking how indication B can support gastric but I don't know indication B and sometimes the best of the 2 indications can impact on - for example if indication B has innovation can help gastric in perceptions, assessment, so I prefer sequence 1. [when talking about how innovation status can impact things, how does it impact price negotiations?] to avoid 70 or 80% discount request from AIFA. If not innovative, the possible risk of pricing by AIFA will be 70% discount.

When we talk about 3K, I'm referring to next price [even if less than 1K patients, still expect 70% reduction?] not linked to patient population, linked with your data - not innovative so bad reputation from the pricing committee as no green light from the scientific committee so pricing committee can request a 70% discount.",DAI475

The safety profile is quite manageable even if the discontinuation rate is quite higher than the comparator. Start to become a bit critical but not impairing the evaluation about reimbursement.

The rationale is fine. It makes sense. The point is that with this scenario is probably different for manufacturers to be reimbursed and to obtain a really high price.  From a payerâ€™s point of view â€“ why did the manufacturers not include European & Spanish patients as they did in trial B. probably efficacy wonâ€™t differ too much, but the SOC could be different. if payers might not feel happy with the reimbursement of this drug when the efficacy seems to be quite low; also â€“ important adverse events, discontinuation is 15%. So, itâ€™s a drug w limited efficacy and adverse events seem to be quite significant. And for trial B there is no control arm, what payers look at is a statistically significant difference between the drug and the control arm. Also, trial B discontinuation is 9%, and 15% for trial A.

It wouldnâ€™t change too much, this piece of info isnâ€™t relevant for pricing and reimbursement in Spain. What is important is that at the end payers are going to reimburse in a context with limited resources and product X represents some additional values in comparison to existent drugs on the market.

Not indirect comparison, this kind of data is not relevant for decision-making in Spain at this moment. Manufacturer might provide this info but itâ€™s not going to be ranked high. 
[Why are they not relevant]
Because payers want to see data from a clinical trial, not from a statistical analysis. What would be important is to have QoL data, to see whether it improves QoL significantly or not. To lie in a bed for this additional time, with limited mobility and your activities are being restricted, in those cases it would be quite ?? 00:23 to reimburse Product X.

",DAI475
21,53,"[What do you think the IPT is going to be]
Probably recommend product X for a certain group of patients for which the treatment is most effective. 
[For who?]
It could also depend on the price the manufacturer requests. Product X would be reimbursed in the case that clinicals see that patients are going to improve when they receive PRODUCT X in comparison to when they receive Irinotecan and paclitaxel. So, Product X could be one more treatment available for oncologists when they prescribe to this kind of ps. And they would decide, because there is not enough clinical evidence w phase2 trial regarding the positioning of Product X within the treatment algorithm. 
[Do you think they would reimburse based on both trials? Or do you think they wonâ€™t reimburse based on trial B, and so 2l wonâ€™t be reimbursed]
Could depend. For other drugs that have been prescribed in 2l they would check if they have a phase 2 trial. There are some benefits for these patients compared to other drugs in the market so it could be reimbursed. 
[In 2l?]
In 2l as well. The point is that if the drug is going to be reimbursed it doesnâ€™t mean the physicians prescribe it necessarily. 
[Youâ€™re saying that it could still be reimbursed depending on the price they ask, basically]
Yes, it could be reimbursed because physicians have limited options for treatment and Product X could be one alternative for this kind of patients. But first, it would have to be affordable, and secondly, there is an important heterogeneity of patients. Probably not all patients with this disease could be candidates to receive it. In those cases in which clinicians think the patients will benefit from Product X, Product X could be prescribed to these patients, not to all of them",DAI475
21,54,"Yes. Who is the final responsible for the elaboration of the therapeutic report is the Spanish Medicines Agency. [So do you think there could be one and why]
Formally the Spanish medicines agency focused on clinical data and ??? (28.32) to make a decision if the drug should be reimbursed or not and make a recommendation to the Spanish Ministry of Health. In this kind of committees, the regions are also sitting, so finally they have to approve the physicianâ€™s report.",DAI475
21,55,"Yes. Sure. I donâ€™t think GPs could prescribe this kind of drugs. Patients are being treated in hospitals and this kind of treatment have to be approved by committees, oncology, pharmacists, also the patients and a group of clinicians and oncologists, so it should be restricted. At the regional level there could be high-level protocols in which they could incorporate Product X and clinicians could follow the recommendations. ",DAI475
21,57,"[And so, you think that the Ministry of Health and regional payers will consider that they investigator choice comparator will be acceptable]
Yes. It could be. Yes, it could be acceptable. They have a control arm, and that should be enough for decision making. In some cases, payers take decisions on the basis, not in this case, of control arm â€“ that could be placebo, SOC... what is important is to have a control arm. ",DAI475
21,60,"[To what extent is cost-effectiveness important, budget impact, in the IPT decision]
Itâ€™s quite important. It could be very important. In those cases, incremental cost to Product X will play a significant role, due to the modest increase in OS, and payers wonâ€™t be able to pay a higher price for Product X. Secondly, I think itâ€™s in 2024, expected that all assessments conducted by the Spanish medicine agency in the therapeutic physicianâ€™s report include a cost-effectiveness analysis. So the role of the cost-effectiveness analysis will be much more important than today.",DAI475
21,61,"[Do you think the payers will make a restriction, based on contraindication, safety risk, or do you think it will be an uptake consideration]
Probably not payers, but clinicians could decide for which group of patients Product X is more beneficial in comparison to other drugs. What payers could estimate in agreement with the manufacturer the number of patients, target population and budget cap.",DAI475
21,63,"[What about regional assessment. Do you think the region will assess the product on top of the IPT?]
If Product X is going to be reimbursed later at a regional level, regions could restrict its use, could restrict it to patients where there is clear evidence of a benefit. 
[Do you think they will do it?]
Yes, absolutely. We have 17 regions. But in mine, we have Catalonia, Madrid, Basque country, Andalusia, all of the regions would make some protocols and it would be more restrictive at the regional level than in the therapeutic report. 
[What kind of restrictions would they impose?]
Restrict its use to a subgroup of patients in which the OS would increase. Just to pay for Product X in those cases where this is going to be the most effective treatment for these patients. 
[And do you know which subgroups of patients it would be?]
No. More data would be necessary first just to know whatâ€™s the efficacy for drugs currently available for these patients. And secondly, what could be the position of Product X and to which group of patients could Product X be prescribedâ€¦ probably not to all of them. 
[what if the manufacturer doesnâ€™t submit a dossier at the regional level]
Whoâ€™s paying for the pharmaceutical expenditure are the regions, so itâ€™s necessary to obtain an agreement at the regional level to make clinicians working in the regions to be able to prescribe Product X. If there isnâ€™t an agreement, clinicians might not prescribe Product X and secondly, the price or a financial agreement would be necessary at the regional level. 
[What would be necessary?]
At the regional level, they would need some info on the clinical benefits of Product X to convince them that it should be financed by the regions, by the regional department of health. Because itâ€™s the regions that pay for the pharmaceutical expenditure, if a manufacturer is not approaching a region, clinicians in that region are not allowed to prescribe the drug. 
[What if the dossiers are not submitted at the regional, local level. Is that a problem?]
Absolutely. Product X wouldnâ€™t be available at the hospital level for oncologists to prescribe this drug. 
It happens in Spain, some regions have some drugs available that others donâ€™t have. These disparities among regions should be reduced to a minimum, but in some cases, they are very important. 
[What if they delay the submission of the dossier at the regional level, until they have another trial. If they do an RCT in 2l, and delay the submission of the dossier until they have the data, what impact will it have?]
I donâ€™t think it could work. Regions are sitting at the national committee. And they share the information. In some cases, some drugs are not reimbursed at the national level simply because some regions refuse the reimbursement of this drug. So itâ€™s not two different, separate entities. And if payers at the national level would be aware of new clinical evidence probably they would wait until more clinical evidence would be available.",DAI475
21,66.d,"[What sort of data would you need? Clearly, comparative data. What else? QoL, PRO, indirect comparisons for trial B?] 
Not indirect comparison, this kind of data is not relevant for decision-making in Spain at this moment. Manufacturer might provide this info but itâ€™s not going to be ranked high. 
[Why are they not relevant]
Because payers want to see data from a clinical trial, not from a statistical analysis. What would be important is to have QoL data, to see whether it improves QoL significantly or not. To lie in a bed for this additional time, with limited mobility and your activities are being restricted, in those cases it would be quite ?? 00:23 to reimburse Product X. So QoL could be quite helpful in pricing and  reimbursement decisions. 
[what about the propensity score analysis. Something that could be done for trial B to match the cohort treated with cyramza and paclitaxel based on the registry data]
This kind of decision is mainly taken by clinicians, pharmacologists, hospital pharmacists, some cases .. this kind of statistical approaches they donâ€™t feel comfortable with this at all. Probably it wouldnâ€™t matter too much. If manufacturer is going to conduct a statistical analysis my recommendation would be to publish the results in a paper or journal. At the end, what they want to see is clinical data not statistical data.",DAI475
21,68,"[And if Product X is not reimbursed, how can they get access. What are their options? What can they do?]
Provide clinical trial evidence in phase 2 with a significant number of patients. The short answer is to provide payers with evidence that Product X would provide some clinical benefit that other drugs wonâ€™t.
[Do they do any form of innovative contracting? Private agreement, risk-sharing agreement..?]
I think itâ€™s not feasible. I remember the case of XXX (41.07), the decision for this drug was not to reimburse. And the point is that they think, the regional level thought that this drug didnâ€™t deserve value for money for reimbursement. They didnâ€™t want the drug at any price, because they didnâ€™t think this drug provides any clinical benefit to patients. 
[So you donâ€™t think they would do any form of contracting]
Probably for certain subgroups of patients the manufacturer could reduce the target indication and the price could be very, very low, that could be the case. But for the proposal they would need some clinical data.",DAI475
21,69,"Whatâ€™s the price reference you have in mind when you look at this profile and prices of other drugs (slide 17,7). We put a list price, then assumed a 40% discount. Correct?]
It could be. The price is different from one hospital to another, even in the same city, and in the same region. The price is being updated every month. XX (00:43) is being used in other indications, and the price for Product X could be the same in 2L and in 3L in case itâ€™s being prescribed in both. Difficult to know the net price. I donâ€™t think the 40% discount applies to all drugs we see in this slide. 
[How would it be different]
It depends from one region to another, one hospital to another. These drugs are being used across different indications, in some cases they have been on the market for a really long time. If a drug has been longer on the market the discount is also higher. 
[Keytruda â€“ are we looking at a bigger discount?]
I think it would be bigger. Itâ€™s being used in diff indications and has been on the market for a long period of time. The same with Nivolumab, discount is likely higher than 40%.
[What do you think an acceptable net price per month would be]
Quite difficult to say. Probably if they take the net price for Keytruda, that could be the reference. 
[Rationale?]
Keytruda is quite affordable, itâ€™s being used in a significant no of patients, and the point is that with Product X on the market being reimbursed, the costs should be affordable. If the price were similar to Keytruda, the budget cost would probably be quite affordable. 
[So youâ€™re looking at something like 6K / month]
Yes. It would also depend on the target population. 
[If you look at both 2l and 3l youâ€™re looking at 500 patients.]
Yes, but the point is that the number of patients that will be treated for the next 2 years. (46:39)
[What would be too expensive? Prohibitively expensive]
Probably 10K.",DAI475
21,79,"[Imagine manufacturer is developing another trial. Slide 20 â€“ imagine they have this additional trial. They would launch with trial a and b, and in parallel they would be running this trial. Same as trial B in terms of population, but it would be an RCT, open-label, vs ramucirumab and paclitaxel. What do you think, could they get a conditional IPT?]
Not likely. Trial C is the kind of data that payers could be looking for. Itâ€™s a phase 3 control arm study. This is the kind of data they would need for decision-making. Probably here an issue would be the population, as itâ€™s just the Asian population. Here the risk is, letâ€™s wait until we have the results from this trial. And the manufacturer should say that data from ph2 is compelling and patients are going to benefit from Product X in the market during that period of time, but payers would say that letâ€™s conduct a clinical trial in Spain, patients could enrol in this trial before the pricing and reimbursement decision has been taken. 
[So you think they would prefer to not give access, and then be like we wait for this data. Correct?]
Yes.
[Do you think they could give access for the subline based on trial A? and for trial B, 2l, they could say no, we wait for trial C]
I donâ€™t think so. When a drug is reimbursed, itâ€™s quite diff to know for which kind of patients it could be prescribed at the hospital. From a payers point of view itâ€™s important that the manufacturer has a budget cap, in the end it doesnâ€™t matter which subgroup of patients receive the new medication. 
[if they are assessed on the basis of trial A+B, and then they show you trial C. Would there be a reassessment]
I donâ€™t think so. Because the process takes a lot of time so the process for the evaluation of IPT could last 1.5 years, and probably the results for trial C wouldnâ€™t even be available in that period of time.
[do you think there could be some price per negotiation?]
I donâ€™t think so. When a drug is on the market, the payers est the max price at which a manufacturer may sell in Spain. Itâ€™s almost impossible to increase the price later. Some competitors could probably arrive on the market, and the price would probably be reduced.",DAI475

Itâ€™s quite difficult to say. For trial 1 we donâ€™t have efficacy data, or control arm. Ph2 with no control. Probably payers could require some additional data, for both trials. So in this case, it makes sense for the manufacturer to obtain some electronical medical record from Spain to know what the SOC is, whatâ€™s the OS w the current drugs. Later to convince payers that OS would increase with Product X. Bu they would need some local info about the soc.

In the clinical practice a different dose may be used when the drug is already being reimbursed. If it happens, it will have some implications on the annual number of units being prescribed and reimbursed, and on the annual budget cap, net prices, discounts, rebates,â€¦

21,137,"[what do you think about the ph2 design and the single arm trial]
Payers donâ€™t like these kinds of trials at all. They need ph3 with a control arm. Probably some payers could refuse to reimburse Product X.
[which payers? Some regional ones?]
Not regional. Probably at the national level. At the national level, they would say that probably resources could be better allocated in some other disease instead of Product X because we donâ€™t know how patients would improve with Product X according to clinical trials. 
[Payers at national level would probably not reimburse? And if they do, you could have regional payers that refuse reimbursement. Correct?]
Probably. Probably the regional level they wouldnâ€™t say they donâ€™t reimburse. But what happened in some cases is that at some regional levels they donâ€™t pay for the drug, and itâ€™s the hospitals that have to pay for it. The hospitals because they donâ€™t have too many resources, they would not purchase the drug.  
[how do they do it when they decide to not pay for it. Do you mean they donâ€™t reimburse?]
The drug could be available at the hospital level, it would be the hospital that would pay for it, they donâ€™t have resources, and later the regional department of health would not compensate the hospitals. Formally, they donâ€™t say the drug wouldnâ€™t be prescribed, but in reality it wouldnâ€™t happen. 
[ 1. Risk of no reimbursement at national level. 2. If itâ€™s reimbursed, there is a risk it wonâ€™t be at the regional level 3. If regions reimburse, they could still leave it to the hospital to fund, which means de facto that it wouldnâ€™t be used because of limited hospital budget]
Correct. There is a risk of no reimbursement  but itâ€™s likely to be a clinical benefit in comparison to other therapy, but the data provided by the manufacturer in ph2 trial is quite limited. A decision about reimbursement would be taken with a very high degree of uncertainty about the clinical endpoints 
[What do you think will happen?]
Probably they could ask the manufacturer to provide additional clinical data, or it could be reimbursed for a very small no of patients. 
[how small, youâ€™re already looking at 200 patients]
Mostly patients in which the OS survival would be quite similar to the one reported in the clinical trial. Patients that could die due to the adverse events (AEs) would probably not receive Product X.",DAI475

[net price â€“ what do you think. 5K as you said earlier or diff]
Yes. I think the discount for most hospitals is higher than 40%. Keytruda has been on the market for several years across diff indications, itâ€™s quite affordable at hospital level. 
[So you think the discount is higher at hospital level for Keytruda?]
Yes. I guess at the hospitals it would be more than 40%. The discount increases year after year. And also for new drugs in the first year the net price vs list price in some cases is 15% or 20%. So I would expect another 20% in another 8 more years.

What effect do you think indication expansion will have on price. Letâ€™s assume weâ€™re now at indication A, 4.7K.  when they expand into B and gastric cancer, what is going to be the price impact]
Probably 20% reduction for the new indications. But youâ€™re assuming the drug would be recommended for reimbursement in gastric and lung cancer. In those cases, 15% or 20% minimum. It could depend on the no of years that Product X has been on the market since they obtained reimbursement for indication A. 
[it would have a 20% decrease?]
It could also depend on the no of units for indication A. As the no of units increases, payers assume that the manufacturer has already covered their development costs. 
[would that 20% apply to all indication expansions? So both indication B and gastric cancer would get a 20% price discount]
Yes
[but earlier, we talked about a price of 5k as being acceptable. But now, starting at 4.7K net price, we would land on a lower price, correct?]
Yes.  ---- [whatâ€™s the rule in Spain when it comes to bundling]
This is a pure negotiation process. Manufacturer requests a price in the nr of patients, then the payer chooses a low price for each target population, and they have to reach an agreement. What is being considered are the nr of years a drug has been on the market, the nr of units to recover R&D costs, competition on the market, efficacy. At this moment with the drugs on the market regions ask for efficacy. Theyâ€™re looking for efficacy in practice, and they check that with the trial reported by the manufacturer. They might ask for additional discounts.",DAI475
21,164,"[and do you think thereâ€™ll be a 20% discount when they expand into NSCLC. Because youâ€™re looking at 200 patients, thatâ€™s very minimal]
It could depend on the price for indication A and B and the no of years that Product X has been on the market for most indications. When a new drug comes to market the discount is usually 15 to 20% minimum. In this case I would assume the same. This drug has been on the market in 2 indications for several years.
[youâ€™re talking about a 20% discount on the net price (4.7K). so you say 4.2K, then another 10 or 20% discount so it would be 3.8K, even less] ? 01:10:52
Yes
[Thatâ€™s way less than the value-based price, and I believe less than the price that we could calculate based on the weighted average. If you look at the weighted average â€“ if we take 6K p/m for Keytruda, the weighted average price is more like 5K. So if we say a bit lower price then maybe itâ€™s more like 4.5K, but itâ€™s not as low as a 20% discount, thatâ€™s quite challenging.]
First of all discounts in the Spanish market are very high at the moment for drugs, specifically in oncology. Secondly, the manufacturer already recovers most of the costs in the 1st and 2nd indication, so the price could be quite similar to the production cost, excluding research and development cost.
[ Youâ€™re saying they would have recovered the cost of development, based on indication A and B, and therefore ..?
And therefore the price could be reduced, normally 100%.
[the manufacturer could tell you itâ€™s very expensive to produce the drug.]
Yes. Prices for oncology drugs can be discounted 70% or 80% in some cases.
[so price decrease of 15 to 20%, would it be on the net level or list price level?]
List price remains the same, what is being negotiated is the net price. List price isnâ€™t being changed anymore.
[Why?]
Spanish legislation. When they reimburse the list price, the list price is going to be maintained forever. Some manufacturers have a production cost higher than the list price. In those cases, they accept to increase the list price. But normally, even with the inflation rate is very high, the list price is always the same. 
[sequence 3. Do you think every single indication expansion would trigger a discount of 15-20%]
Could depend on the no of patients. Price could be reduced with new indications, it wouldnâ€™t be 20% for each indicationâ€¦ for these cases it could be around 5-10%. 
[for which?]
For every single additional indication. Indication B, gastric and NSCLC.",DAI475
21,168.m,"[Challenge. Slide 26. In sequence 1 you told me 20%, and I can see why, because itâ€™s quite a broad indication expansion (from A to B and gastric). But here 20% seems huge, because youâ€™re only adding 250 patients (from B and gastric to NSCLC); sequence 3, s.27: and here you tell me that they do 5-10% for each indication expansion, I wonder, then why not 5% for the expansion from A & gastric to NSCLC, as seen in slide 26] 
Iâ€™m just guessing that NSCLC could be later in time, and manufacturer also recovered R&D costs. Itâ€™s been on the market for 3 previous indications. 
[so your point is really that theyâ€™ve recouped that cost]
Yes. And also the drug has been on the market for a certain period of time. 
[slide 28. Which sequence do you think makes most sense?]
It could be important to know what is the indication for A and B? breast cancer, prostate cancer..?
[no, it would be a diff cancer, with 2 000 population for A, ? for B (1:19:56), and weâ€™re assuming the drug would prove its efficacy]
The point is whether this niche market is going to be competitive or not. Also the drugs available for the line of treatment for A and B indication. With stronger competition, the net price will be reduced further. 
[what do you mean]
So what makes more sense for me is sequence 3. I think itâ€™s the best. Weâ€™re making a lot of assumptions, but depending on the assumptions the result could be quite different. With 3, the manufacturer proposes a new indication and obtains a decision. With 1, they are asking for 2 indications. Indication B and gastric cancer could make up a significant number of patients in those indications. The drug would be reduced even when weâ€™re talking about a small nr of patients, but in those cases the nr of patients would be higher. Also for 3, the time period the drug has been in the market is much longerâ€¦",DAI475

It is important to try to decrease the uncertainties in efficacy, in safety, etc. No one clinical trial can provide zero doubts about any topics. It is important to apply to the MoH with an important help, a very good professional that knows the development of the drug. This is very important.",DAI475
22,10,"I think that the results are quite interesting, the question is, we have two phase 2 clinical trials, open label, with a relatively low number of patients so, of course in the open label is possible to have some bias or problem at the analysis, it depends if the analysis of the data is a committee that is blinded and those details are important. But if we trust on those results, its true that in the pivotal in trial B in second line is a single arm, so we are forced to make indirect comparisons. But for example, comparing the population are similar, it is possible to make this indirect comparison. The progression (! 11:29) of survival of this product is much higher than the ramucirumab clinical trial and the same with the OS. On the trial B second line, if I try to compare these results with ramucirumab + combined with the best standard of care, in ramucirumab I see that the progression of survival is only 2 month, the OS is 5 months, more less. Making these indirect comparisons, I see that the results are better. And in third line in the trial A, we have a comparator, that probably is a good comparator, but the difference is on the response rate and the OS and the progression of survival, the difference is above the minimum threshold that should be the difference.",DAI475
22,11.b,"[Trial A, what do you think about the comparator. Do you think that is the right one, the physicians choice of therapy?]
We see that in the third line, we have the chemotherapy, so we could use taxane + irinotecan, this match with the recommendation in third line. ",DAI475
22,11.c,"[What do you think about the Asian Population? Do you have any concerns about the transferability of the data?]
The first impression is not a concern. But I would need to study the inclusion and exclusion criteria in trial A to reaffirm, being sure of that. But the first impression is that is not a problem. 
[Your first impression is that is not a problem, tell me more about it. Because I know that this can be a problem]
You mean the trial population included in the clinical trial? 
[Yes, if you look at trial A, you have about 200 patients and they are all from Asians population] 
oh! I didnâ€™t understand. Yes, in this case of course! The Asian population could have a different ethnicity and genetic profile. Yes, it could be a concern on the Spanish national level evaluation.",DAI475
22,11.d,"[Trial A, what about the choice ORR as a primary endpoint and mOS as a secondary endpoint. Do you think that ORR would be accepted by the Spanish payer?]
Yes, I think that it is not a big issue, because it is interesting to see the response rate and I remember maybe other clinical trials phase 2, not phase 3, that try to assess what is the response.  
[but in the phase 3 trial, you would need to see OS?]
Yes, in this case, in both situations, probably we cannot expect a curation, so the PFS should be the primary outcome or if not the OS.
[What do say, you would not expect?]
If cancer, we should not expect curation, its not that curative treatment with the PFS we are very happy. Because the PFS collects the effect of the drug. The OS could be moderated by all subsequent treatments that can be used after product X.",DAI475
22,11.e,"[What do you think about the magnitude of the effect? 50% ORR, 12 months of mOS, what do you think of them â€“ in trial A?]
In trial A the difference in the response rate is very high, but probably among the patients that response the difference after that in terms of OS is not very very important [What do you mean?] Despite the patient response, after that progress very quickly. After the medium 5.5 months, itâ€™s the difference is on the borderline, an absolute two month difference between one or other treatment is the minimum required. In terms of OS, the difference is more or less consistent with the difference in the PFS but can be moderated by other treatments. In this case, maintains and increases the difference so its very well. 
[What do you think of the Hazard ration and the OS]
The Hazard ratio is a secondary parameter and in this case is consistent and itâ€™s interesting that any hazard ratio below 0.7 is interesting. 0.5 is much more interesting but I prefer to see the Kaplan Meyer curves because I see what is the long-term response. I am very interested in the proportion of patients that they have, not a short term response but a long term, if this is the case, I donâ€™t know.",DAI475
22,13,"[what do yo think about the safety of both trials?]
It is a little bit concerning, especially the severe adverse events that are difficult to manage, the interstitial lung disease or the pneumonitis are concerning.
[do you think that safety data could be a problem for reimbursement?] 
No, but because the prognostic of the majority of the patients is bad. Of course, decreases the value and the price of the product.",DAI475
22,14.a,"[What IF THE IM Says THAT TRIAL B is a pivotal trial and trial A is a supportive trial. Would that change anything to your perception]
Yes, if the trial a is supportive in third line, there is another trial A that will be pivotal in third line I suppose. Or not?
[Not necessarily]
But if the manufacturer want to have an indication in third line, will need a pivotal clinical trial in order to get the indication from the IM
[do you think that the IM say trial B, pivotal, trial A supportive, do you think that in Spain you would not reimburse trial A?
I donâ€™t know. I mean there are two different situations and indications. One thing is 2L and other thing is 3L. both indications will need different applications to get the different indications and each indication will need pivotal clinical trial. So, I would expect a phase 3 pivotal clinical trial. 
[and if you donâ€™t, have it?]
Difficult to answer, but one thing would be temporary reimbursement until phase 3. If phase 3 will not be conducted again, waiting for the result of the real-world data in the frame of the national health system. I remember some previous experiences about reimbursement drugs with only phase 2, and that at the moment of reimbursement we knew that phase 3 probably will not be conducted. 
[if phase 3 is never conducted?]
Yes, because of that I think that is not a fair point situation but it could be possible to provide a temporary reimbursement and waiting for the data of the phase 4, real world data, from the Spanish patients in the frame of the Spanish national health system
[but if the IM would say that, that trial A is supportive, you would still provide reimbursement, correct?]
Yes, it depends on the unmet needs that in this case is high in third line. Its true that we have other alternatives, but it seems that the figures from the product here is higher. It depends on the efficacy, safety, and response ratio.",DAI475

But I the product is launched after 1st January 2025, for sure we will have a cost-effective analysis, cost effectiveness cost per qualy.",DAI475
22,52,"[do you think that the HER2+ indication will be prioritized, so it would be coordinated by Revalmed?]
Yes, I donâ€™t see any problem in this topic. Itâ€™s a subgroup of patients, so the target population is low and this is a more severe situation or is a risk factor, the prognostic is worse. I think yes. But in Spain, even if it is an orphan drug, the timings is a topic that we are talking a lot, theoretically the IPT should be done in 6 months maximum and this is not accomplished, 9 months, 12 months. Even in the situation that it should run very fast, itâ€™s not achieved.",DAI475
22,53,"I would expect two IPTs or one that collects both indications. I assume that in both cases would be positive because the IPT is just collecting the information from the clinical trial and will collect the efficacy, safety administration and at least in efficacy will be positive, not extremely positive, but positive, with the concern around the safety data. At the end probably will say to the minister of health â€˜consider to reimburse thisâ€™, but the minister of health also will assess the product will take into account the efficacy and safety considerations.  ---[you said it would be reimbursed, I assume temporary reimbursement for trial A and for trial B also temporary reimbursement?]
In both cases, because it is a phase 2 clinical trial but in the case of trial B, there are more arguments because it is a single arm clinical trial. But I think that in both cases the MOH will not be happy a definitive reimbursement. - [Will you do Cost effectiveness Nice (! 36:24), because I was reading somewhere that basically Spain is copying NICE and that manufacturers will have to submit HTA within the next 5 years. Is that true?]
Yes, they are saying. I am not a health economist, I am physician, clinical pharmacologist but they are saying that they appreciate a lot if the manufacturer can provide an economical model in order to change foreign number by Spanish numbers. They accept this, especially in some models is much more complicated to do this. 
[what about the regions? Do you think they are going to do their own assessment on top of the IPT?]
In Spain we are 17 regions and some of them, I work in CataluÃ±a, Madrid, Vascan, Navarra, Aragon, Andalucia, they make their own assessment, and this is useful to position the drug and to send the advice to the health providers about the therapeutical position, etc. But other regions, specially the smaller, they donâ€™t have the structure, technicians and they wait for the Spanish society of hospital pharmacy, previously named Genesis group, they make a very interesting, large document that assess the drug for the regions, for those regions and hospitals. 
[Some regions will make their own...]
The others share the hospital pharmacy society document.
[what if the dossier would not be submitted at the local and regional level, would that be a problem?]
The manufacturer presents the documentation to the national level and after that does not present to the regions? [Yes] but the regions in the regional assessment they do need, the manufacturer, nothing. They look at the IPA(!39:09), they search the clinical trials then they start the assessment. Its is not necessary. The manufacturer at the national level starts an application because they asked to be reimbursed at the national level, after the reimbursement decision and price level and price negotiation the work of the manufacturers stop and the region starts the regional assessment but it is not necessary and active paper of the manufacturer. 
[so they will start their assessment ..]
The region start the regional assessment autonomously and they are autonomous to find the information, the documents, the evidence. 
[if the manufacturer tries to delay their submission until they have some phase 3 data, will they still run their assessment, without the dossier, or do you think they will be waiting?]
the MOH will wait. There are some manufacturers that are thinking about if it would be interesting to be reimbursed in Spain, because of the prices, because of several things, and there are cases where the manufacturer waits, delays a little bit the application to the national reimbursement in the national health system",DAI475
22,54,"Yes, the amps has a national HTA. Revalmed evaluation is under the umbrella of the Spanish agency of drugs. ",DAI475
22,55,"Yes, because of the level of specialization, because of the cost of the treatment. All those drugs are restricted to hospital use. ",DAI475
22,58.b,"[What risk does it create from the reimbursement perspective?
Well, according to unmet need, according to the promising results. I probably would be open to provide a temporary reimbursement with the condition that this reimbursement can change after 1, 2, 3 years, and we will have the information from the oncologists that have used the drug and the use of this drug should be in the patient registry, so the oncologist will need to fill about the previous treatments, the clinical status of the health problem in the patient, the costs of the treatment, this information will be real world data from the national system and this could be useful to decide â€˜okay, in Spanish population we could find similar results to the clinical trial, so the reimbursement will be maintained or notâ€™.
[So, they would basically need real world data, based on registries, etc]
Yes, but made after the temporary reimbursement. The MoH would propose this temporary reimbursement and waiting for the real-world efficacy and safety of course, but mainly efficacy. If the efficacy is (inaudible 16:05) in the Spanish patients.
[What do you think the region would do? Do you think the region would be stricter?]
No, if there are national condition and statements, the regions should accept this. If the national MoH says â€˜this is reimbursedâ€™ then this is reimbursed, and the region cannot say â€˜this is not reimbursedâ€™ in the contrary. If at the national level this is not reimbursed, the regions cannot reimburse and the patient profiles and the conditions will be the same. But it could happen that the product could have a very very high price and the regions decide, like the case of ramu, saying to the health providers that this drug should be exceptional and when the regions says that it should be used exceptionally and the end, they keep the use very low or zero. 
[What do you mean exceptionally? Who would they give the drug to? because you are not seeing a lot of patients]
The oncologist in the public health system, they are able to prescribe it, because the MOH said that this is reimbursed but maybe the cost of the treatment is 30,000 eur and the region will say to the health providers â€˜ well, to pay 30,00, for an increase in the OS of 4 months, this is too expensive. So you should be exceptional. The regions make this kind of advise because of the efficiency an cost of the product.",DAI475

Yes, but we need some clinical trials with the standard of care, should be present in clinical trials with a similar population. Making indirect comparisons  is not the best way but if we donâ€™t have any other choice of course we would do indirect comparison, but it is not the best situation, of course. The second point is that, usually the MOH provides reimbursement after phase 3 clinical trial, but in some situations if we have a very urgent unmet need, and we donâ€™t have any other thing, the MOH can offer a temporary reimbursement with phase 2 clinical trial, but this is not a common situation.",DAI475

[what would they compare against? Because in this case is 2L, single arm. What would they compare against, knowing that ramu is not approved in Spain. Would they still compare against it?]
No, ramucirumab is reimbursed, the question is that the regions they consider that the drug is too efficacious, but ramucirumab is reimbursed in both situations is monotherapy and combined with paclitaxel. So, after the national reimbursement, the regions consider that for this 2 months difference, the cost of the treatment is too expensive. Itâ€™s reserved for some exceptional patients that the oncologist considers that the patient needs, for example, very young or they have some factors we could expect a better response.

[nothing very innovative, no outcome-based contract or indication-based contract]
No, at national level the MOH does not like veery much the outcome-based agreement only in 15 very expensive drugs, very innovative, with very high risk on the pharmacy budget and the regions we only have CataluÃ±a with 25 recent agreements and Galicia is starting, so very few, and Asturias. It seems that in Asturias there are a lot of recent agreements. But only 3 regions in 17. in general no.",DAI475
22,69,"It depends on the what is the first indication. Idk if the product will apply at the same time with both indications or not
[they would launch in A and B together]
I suppose that the rational will be to take into account the cost of ramucirumab as a benchmark, because the cost of paclitaxel or docetaxel its very very low. 
[I will show you the cost of drugs in gastric cancer, do you think they would at Pembrolizmab, because it is also used in second line?]
I donâ€™t think so. I forgot to say that the MOH tries to look at the pharmacological group the ATC group if the product is a PDL 1 drug or is another drug, they try to look at this. If product X is the first in class, we probably would look at ramucirumab cost. 
[what type of cost per drug per month would you expect for this drug]
Using MOH the product is a premium price over ramucirumab price. This is a very high cost and also the MOH will take into account the profile, it will say that the product will be used more than ramucirumab so the target population will be higher and the duration of the treatment probably will be higher. 
[So you say it will be used more than ramucirumab, because it has better efficacy?]
Exactly, because the PF is longer, it is 2 months vs 5 months. The duration of the treatment will be longer. The total cost of the treatment should be divided by the number of months. 
[we made an assumption of list and net. If you look at ramucirumab 7,800 for list price. And we are assuming that oncology products these days, they have about 40% discounts. Do you think this is true?]
It is probably correct, the confidential discount in Spain depends on the level of list price, when the level is very high, 7k, 10k, the confidential discount could be 50% so from 0 to 50%. If the cost is 30k, we will probably see more in the future, because of the new economic threshold, probably the confidential discount would be around 20-22. 
[What would be an acceptable net price? Would it be around 4,700 per month?]
It depends on the moment of assessment, but I think that the MOH will try to use the Spanish threshold and calculate the number of Qalys and open to pay 25,000 per QALY. If the number of qalys is lower, its 0.5 Qalys, the MOH will be willing to pay 12 or 13k per total cost. 
[Per month, if the qaly threshold is met, how much?]
I donâ€™t know the number of qaly, but imagine it is 1. This is 25k. And the number of months is 5, so why not, 5k per month. Could be fair because the treatment seems more efficacious than ramu. 
[so basically, 25k per course?]
Yes, per treatment, in some patients would be shorter or longer.

Sometimes we donâ€™t have a clinical comparator, we donâ€™t hae price comparator. In this case if the drug is belongs to a pharmacological group of HER2+ treatment like trastazumab, ramucirumab, etc. probably the MOH will look at the prices of this pharmacological group but basically the prices will be determined by the benefits in the efficacy, efficacy safety cost. They will use OS, progression of survival, and trying to evaluate the cost per qaly. 
[is it new that they look at the cost per qaly?]
No, its not determined. I say that this will be used if the product is launched after 2025. If the product is launched this year or 2024, maybe they will be a pharmacological analysis of maybe not. The closer to 2025, the higher the risk of having this HTA. 
[net price per month for this drug in lung cancer]
The MOH will study what is the effect of the drug, making some comparison with the use of chemotherapy, the additional number of qalys, maybe it will be less than one, or probably the cost of the treatment will be less than 25k per treatment.

the patients progress very soon, and we are not talking about a treatment that probably will last more than one year. Looking at those clinical trials, we see that the progression is after 5 months.

Yes, always start the procedure, maybe at the end of the procedure the discount on this price or the increase on the confidential discount will be 0 or 1 or 2. It depends on many factors, if the increase in the target population is very low, usually the MOH consider that the revenues to the manufacturer always should increase, because it is a new indication, more population and we should appreciate the effort to make this new research. The global revenue should increase, but the cost per treatment should decrease, maybe 1%, 2%. It depends on the initial price.  [One payer in Spain told me that the decrease is always on the net price, he told me that the list price is always protected. Is this true?]
Its true. It depends if the drug has a confidential discount. The drugs for diabetes have a new indication and the change was not in the list price because these products donâ€™t have a confidential discount. But in general, in oncology all the drugs have a confidential discount. It is easier to increase a confidential discount and not modify the list price. But other drugs like anticoagulants that are retail pharmacy drugs, in this case we donâ€™t have any other choice to decrease the list price. In this case those drugs where the increase the target population is considerable, and the reduction on the list price is2%, 3%,5% maximum.",DAI475

We think that the net price after launch of indication would be about 4,700 per month. There would be indication B and gastric cancer launched together. Can they bundle those 2 indications?]
They can apply at the same time, no problem. But the MOH will take into account the increase in the patients is 6,500 and it is a very important increase, compared to the number of patients in indication A
[currently the size of indication A is 1,900. The size of indication B + gastric cancer would be almost double. What do you think would happen in terms of price?]
That does not mean that there will be a reduction of 50%, but why not 20, 22%. It depends on the value, efficacy and safety ration in indication A and B. if the efficacy in the new indication is less important than in the previous indication, the risk of reduction is higher and the magnitude of the reduction, probably will be higher. But if the drug is very very interesting in the new indications, maybe the price erosions may be lower.
[lower than 20%?]
Yes, maybe 10%, 15%. 
[what will happen when they expand into lung cancer -250 patients-?] 
Maybe no change, or 1%. If we have a different behaviour, technically we are able to decide â€˜we donâ€™t change any priceâ€™ and you will provide 1 treatment every 10 or every 20 to the hospital. But at the end is a small discount. [Same but, they would launch indication B and only then they would launch indication on gastric cancer. What do you think can happen in case of price discount?]
When indication B and gastric cancer indication are in two different moments, I would expect a price negotiation. Probably the final price would be the same, but I think in general is more interesting is better to join 2 indications in the same negotiation. Because the risk of price reduction 1 by 1 is higher, the MOH tries to take advantage of this and when there are 2 indications it seems that 10% + 10%, or 20%+20%, it seems that at the end this is a high reduction. This Is from the external point of view; this is the rationale. 
When 2 indications are in the time with less than 12 months, the MOH will wait to assess at the same time. 
[from a HTA perspective?]
If the minister of health knows that, for example, we are applying now for indication B, but they know from the EMA, that this product has a new indication, probably the MOH will apply in less than 12 months. The MOH, probably will contact the manufacturer and say â€˜I would be interested in assessing both indications at the same timeâ€™. A the end is two different documents and two different assessments but the negotiation is only 1. 
[So, the HTA assessment would be one, but they would make 2 reports and then they will do the pricing negotiation together.

Exactly 
[if they were not doing it, what do you think will be the price discount, when they launch indication B, when they launch gastric and mnsclc]
I see that the population in indication A + B, i suppose that first is indication A and after is indication B, where the indication B I assume that this is doubling the population and I suppose that in this case the discount would be probably around 20-22%
[and what about agc]
The target population is around 1k, probably in this case the discount could be 5% maximum 10.

22,176,"[any flag that I should be aware of, any advice?]
The manufacturer should balance if it is more interesting to have the price now and a temporary price with a phase 2 clinical trial and after that having the risk of reduction if the new evidence is not so interesting. Or if the manufacturer trust a lot with the phase 3 clinical trial and it is more interesting for the phase 3 clinical trial and will have definitive reimbursement, the price would be stable, etc etc. The quality of the evidence is crucial, because if we have some uncertainties or doubts the risk of not reimbursing the indication is very important. If I have a very good drug, where efficacy/safety ration is much higher than other drugs in the same pharmacological group, in this case I would not wait time about a very very high price that can delay a lot the negotiation. I remember lots of dossiers in the table just because the 2 economical proposals were so different that the dossiers remained on the table because the MOH consider that this is not possible to be paid. It would be more interesting, okay allow a higher price and after that I will accept a very important confidential discount in this case, even more than 40% confidential discount, 50%, 60%.

It is a global database for cancer around the world where Spain provides very good data. I know oncology, I donâ€™t work on this area, just former payer.

I really recommend you provide these. And also, one important issue for payers is, you show here only prevalence data, but payers want to see prevalence and incidence: because many of this patients (! 03:24), the prevalence is important, but also the incidence.

For example, (inaudible!  04:25), here, we have 380 patients. Let me give you a very stupid example, in my (inaudible ! 04:33), this 30% of this population are smoker, in the clinical trial smoker are excluded.

It is not the market share; it is mainly the type of population according with the criteria that was included in the clinical trial.  [In terms of the considerations about budget impact, is that also focused on the eligible population per the clinical trial?]
Yes. This is a very good question. In Spain the pricing and investment is a two step process, the first one is the clinical efficacy and economic data and then the budget impact. As long as you demonstrate that the product has very clear additional clinical value, you demonstrate cost-effectiveness then you discuss about the budget impact, but we donâ€™t started to discuss â€œoh this is 380 patients payâ€, â€œoh, I donâ€™t want to cover, it is a lot populationâ€. No, sorry, I donâ€™t care right now, at this stage, I donâ€™t care I see 380.

One, is the head-to-head in Europe. And then you say â€˜no, we donâ€™t have in Europe, we have in Asia and we have data in Franceâ€™. But we request one single request: the clinical trial in Europe.

Indirect treatment comparison can be acceptable if you can justify why you donâ€™t perform a head-to-head. Why we donâ€™t like indirect treatment comparison? Because we donâ€™t have the guarantee, 100%, that the population in both clinical trials are the same. Let me give you an example, if you say, â€˜you know, we donâ€™t can not make a head to headâ€™. Why? Because product X is a product that is a subcutaneous every 6 months and Ramu is a oral pill per day. So, it is difficult to randomize. If you provide a very good justification. We can just â€œoh, it is better to have a indirect treatment comparison, because difficult to randomise this two populations. But in this case, I donâ€™t know the dose or administration. In second line we want to see head-to-head, we donâ€™t want to see indirect treatment comparison.",DAI475

We can wait, we are not going to provide conditional reimbursement based on the other clinical trials. We are going to wait to have the outcome of this one in order to reimburse it.

Because we donâ€™t need this product. We are waiting for investment when we have evidence. We can give provisional reimbursement when you came with an ultra-orphan disease, there is nothing in the market, (inaudible 35:55) very high unmet need. Right now, in second line, there is no unmet need. I mean, there is unmet need for better efficacy, but we want to see the better efficacy.",DAI475

Only trial C would be evaluated, the other are not going to be consider. Only this one.
[Only second line, not second line and later?]
No, this product is trying to (inaudible 36:47) second line, only second line is going to be considered. Even more, second line according to the inclusion, exclusion criteria. Let me give you an example, if you excluded in the clinical trial a patient that have smoker, we are going to exclude a patient that smoke. Not the label, the label plus exclusion and inclusion criteria.
[The IML label would probably be: patients second line or later, but here is just second line]
Yes. And the exclusion and inclusion criteria of the clinical trial. If you have in the clinical trial third line... the problem with third line is that you donâ€™t have the right comparator, because ramucirumab is not used in the third line. 
[in the assessment, when you said restricted to the EC/IC is just saying that it will only be reimbursed in that population?]
Yes, only in the same population that was included in the clinical trial. 
[In this assessment, how important is cost effectiveness and budget impact?]
Right now, I told you that the IPT would be very positive for the clinical point of view, but right now, many of the IPT are not really focused on the clinical data, they are focused on the efficacy data, plus cost effectiveness. So if you pass the IPT for the clinical point of view and the cost effectiveness point of view, you can go later to the present committee to discuss about the budget. But let me give you an example, product X vs ramu plus â€¦cel (inaudible 38:58) and you are improving something like FIMO (! 39:00), so improving 50%, thatâ€™s a very good improvement. Imagine that ramu + cel (inaudible 39:10) cost â€¦.",DAI475
23,84.b,"[I have the cost, ramu + plaqâ€¦. What cost do you need? ]
Total cost per patient per year, doesnâ€™t matter if the patient needs 5 cycle, 10 cycle, we donâ€™t care, we really care about the total cost per patient per year. Doesnâ€™t matter the number of cycles that the patient needs. 
[what if the patient takes it for less than a year, if it is a dollar per month and you only take it for 7 months, are you interested in the cost being 7 dollars or 12 dollars]
No, if the cost is 1 dollar, and the patient takes only 7 months only, and there is stop. The total cost per year is 7 dollars. 
[Okay, so for ramu per year, we are estimating on a net basis is around 25,000]
Do you have the official list price? Or do you want to discussâ€¦ because it is impossible spent (! 41:00) discuss the net price, but its okay. 
[On slide number 7 is where we have some of our prices. So, we were estimating for Cyramza that there is around of 40% discount from the list price to the net price. So thatâ€™s the assumption we are working on. Ideally we would like to discuss on a net price basis, obviously we know everything is confidential so we donâ€™t actually know that, we are just guessing that it is a 40% listing net, and going based on that]
If we are assuming this, let me do a quick analysis (He spends time doing calculations). Can I share my screen? Because I make a very quick and non-professional analysis (shares screen). 
 
We have here the 25,000 it is the comparator; we have the efficacy that is the 10.8 divided by 12. This is the product X 15.4 divided by 12. This are the formulas. We donâ€™t have a specific threshold in Spain, that is a 30,000 pound per QALY that there is in England. If you request 35 (inaudible 43:54) reimbursed. If you request something like 37, you are in the link (! 44:01). So, something will be 37 could be the price that can be accepted. I think that is the question that you wanted to ask to me. 
[Right, so given the incremental benefit of OS and the cost effectiveness, you are saying that a price around 37,000 could be justified based on cost effectiveness?]
Yes, and automatically you will go to the pricing competition. If you request this and this would be the outcome, there is no point on the discussion, automatically you going to be approved. I donâ€™t expect it that with the population that we discussed at the beginning, this kind of 350 patient in second line,  there is no going to be a very strong discussion about population. Of course we need to multiply it, because we are not increasing so much, we are increasing only 12,000 euros per patient. If we multiply, it would be 12,000 multiplied for 300 patients, would be 7 million euros; not really (inaudible 45:15) that payer is really worry about that. 
In this range of course, we are not going to reimburse the 300 patients because we are using the exclusion, inclusion criteria. So, assume that is going to be 400 patient, we are going reimburse all of it without any problem. 
[it sounds like the cost- effective price is the beginning of the discussion when it comes to price and then they also consider budget impact, but here because the volume or the target population is definitely on the smaller side, budget impact probably wonâ€™t be a significant concern]
The only problem that we can have is, imagine that this product, if we look for the inclusion and exclusion criteria is only applied for 300 patients, only for the 50%. Payer is very concern that no one is going to use these criteria and is going to be overprescribing for the full population. In order to avoiding that, is very typical to have budget cap and this (inaudible 46:41) â€˜oh, you know what, if we look at the inclusion, exclusion criteria, we are looking that is only 300 patients, we are going to budget cap and we are not going to reimburse more than 300 patients. Its not because we are concerned about the budget, in this case, I told  you before, we are concerned about overprescribing outside the population that was included in the clinical trial. 
[the budget cap would be based on the clinical trial population?]
Yes, inclusion and exclusion criteria. [Are there any other contracts or agreements like that that you would expect any sort of cost sharing, duration based contract, outcomes based agreement. Anything else that you would expect?]
Not really, because why not an outcome-based agreement? Because the clinical trial, the one that you showed to me in the slide, the trial C, is a very good clinical trial, you have a comparator. When we are discussing about outcome-based agreement, we have about 15, is mainly orphan medicine that are coming with a phase 2 trial, no comparator, without (!48:18) uncertainty. Here one I see your slide number 20, I donâ€™t have any uncertainties, if we apply to the right population we can have a very good improvement. We are expected that is (inaudible 48:35). If you go with the price that we commented before I donâ€™t expect any problem. 
[Next step is that local or regional dossiers are submitted as well..]
No, this used to be in the past. You are totally right, before we decide to make an spending the IPT, the regional authority used to make regional assessments. Right now, the national IPT is something that is coordinated by the national authorities, but is mainly by regional experts. So, it is not going to be this reassessment for someone thatâ€™s make an assessment a few months ago at the national level, so no. 
[So, after this IPT is decided, the manufacturer would not need to submit at local level?]
No, never. If the pricing committee has decided to reimburse this product, with this price. But the local authorities is going to request discount, always. But they are not going to restricted additional to the one that has been restricted at the national level, never. I do not expect a reassessment at the local level.",DAI475
23,85.b,"[Regarding trial C, what if instead of a 15.4 OS for product X, it was a 12-month survival, similar to trial B. How does it change your thoughts or perspectives?]
I can share again the screen, I can make again the ICER, and youâ€™ll notice the difference. (shares screen).  So now, it wonâ€™t be 15.4, is going to be 12 and the comparator is 10.8 (changes number in the cost, trying 37, 27, 28), yes around 28. 
 
[Right, because that results in an ICER 30k]
Yes.
[Okay, for the ICER, what threshold is typically acceptable that you are looking for?]
The main difference with England and Spain, is that we donâ€™t have explicit threshold, like the 30,000 per QALY. Right now, in this analysis I am using 30, normally im using around 25-30. But if you go to Spain with this analysis is going to be accepted. For example, if you go to 30, and it goes like this (shows ICER 50,000 on the screen), then is not going to be accepted. If you go 29 (shows ICER 40,000), no. So 28 is the maximum that can be.",DAI475

A phase2, single arm study is not going to be acceptable, take into account that It can be acceptable for market authorization, but for the payer point of view and this is related to the slide number 23, because you are going to ask me the level of additional clinical value, sorry but with a single arm, I donâ€™t know.

We are discussing first line; first line is different to the one we are discussing now. If you go to slide 12, in first line we have PDL 1, PDL 1 + chemotherapy, PDL 1 + bevacizumab, PDL + ipilumab. We need to have a head-to-head in first line. 
[If the manufacturer completed a head-to-head study in first line and it was compared to the investigator choice, cisplatin/carboplatin, pemetrexed, or pembrolizumab. When that data comes out, would that trigger a reassessment for this product X. Frist line]
Yes, right now in first line in NSCLC we have different alternatives, fi you come with a new clinical trial, in first line and you have better efficacy, we are going to make an assessment and the manufacturer can request a premium price, it is very simple. Is the one that we discussed previously, the third line, with a very good data, 50 vs 10. Okay, this is what we expect, the additional clinical value and cost effectiveness analysis. There is no difference in first line, second line, third line, the only difference is the comparator that you choose and also in the inclusion criteria. If you want to go to second line, one of the inclusion criteria patients have to have one previous treatment. If you go to first line, the inclusion criteria is naÃ¯ve (! 01:06:58) patient. [Another scenario. EMA reviews this product and approves it for second line, based on trial 1 and 2 that are shown. The manufacturer have this follow up data on first line, but the EMA hasnâ€™t updated their regulations yet. For the EMA it is a second line product. How does that play out?]
If you have a product that has been approved by EMA in second line, and later you have first line data, but you donâ€™t have yet EMA label in first line. You can no reimbursement in Spain, because it would be off label use. The manufacturer has first line data, then need to get to EMA, get label for first line, and then you need to request price reimbursement in Spain in first line. Let me clarify that, if you have approval in second line, no one is going to guarantee that you are going to get approval in first line. And, if you have approval in the second line and go to first line, you need to reduce the price, because you are going to increase the patient volume. In Spain, when you have a new indication, normally a broad indication, normally first line is much more broad than second line, you need to reduce the price. 
[Let me summarize and correct me if incorrectly captured this. Head to head trial, showing data in first line, would not impact any of the IPT assessment in second line.. ]
No.
[and reimbursement in first line would only happen, once the EMA has approved the product in first line]
Yes.",DAI475
23,162,"[There are multiple indications that they are thinking about. Questions high level on indication sequencing. If a product is on the market is reimbursed and has a price. And it launches into a second indication. Is there any minimum discount that is expected with indication expansion? Or if it is really a super small population, like a 2% increase. Do you think you can maintain the price?]
When you have an indication expansion, there are 2 criteria in order to discuss about the price discount in the second indication. The first criteria is additional number of patient, you tell me that is only 2%, so it is almost nothing. The second criteria is, what is the price of the alternatives in this new indication. Because if the price of the new indication is very expensive you need to reduce the price, probably nothing, but if the price of the alternative medication in the new indication is very very cheap, probably you need to reduce a little bit more, in order to perform in the cost effective analysis that we discussed before. 
Depending on this criteria, additional number of patients, and clinical value of the (inaudible 01:11:49) in this second indication. 
[Say, the price of the new indication is similar to the existing price, or the price of the other therapies are a lot higher and itâ€™s a small population size. Do you think there is a chance for an increase in price?]
No, this has never happened. High possibility not to request to you the raise the price. But in Spain, I have been working for 20 years in this area and this has never happened, that in a second indication you get increasing the price. To maintain the price is a good news. 
[It is possible to potentially maintain the price]
Yes, this is possible according to the criteria that you commented, only 2% of population. 
[What if the population increases more around 10%, what are your thoughts]
You need to make an analysis, 10%, it looks that there is no a lot of population, but we need to see the clinical value. As a summary, 10% doesnâ€™t look like nobody is going to request a very high price with 10%.",DAI475
23,168.m,"[Slide 28, there is 4 indications. We went through the ones in grey and green. The two others that could launch before are A and B, letâ€™s say the data looks good on those indications as well. What are the implications of those two different sequences, in terms of price renegotiation?]
I really recommend sequence 1. People in the minster of health are very busy, in sequence 1 we are reducing 1 negotiation process. Because we are going to have only 3 negotiation process, one for the indication 1, another for indication 2 and aGC and another for SCLC. So we reduce 1 negotiation process. So, I recommend sequence 1. 
[Indication A and B are very big compared to aGc and SCLC. It seems like the biggest price discount that the payers are going to expect is from indication A to indication B.]
Mainly for the B, because of the A would be the price setting, so itâ€™s the B. 
[So you are saying that sequence 1 would be favourable because there are few negotiations. Do you think, in terms of price evolution, it helps to put gastric cancer and indication B together. Maybe indication B would expect 20% discount, and gastric cancer separately they would expect 10% discount, but together instead of 30% they can expect only 25%? Or not necessarily?]
Yes, you can compensate it. This is the right path. Normally when you go together you can compensate one issue with the other. Because if you go scenario 1 and they request you 20% discount, for indication B, because it is a huge discount. And aGC is small ones, okay 20% will be enough for both indication.  
If you go to indication A, indication B 20% discount, and you go to aGC, â€˜oh I want to have 5% discount additionalâ€™, so yeah, this is the route. But again this is very theoretical, we need to see the clinical value in order to make comments. My opinion is go to negotiate it together. 
[When you were saying the clinical value also impacts some of the considerations, what were your thoughts there?]
We need to see profile A, profile B, profile C and D, to think of every case. Letâ€™s assume that indication A is approved, indication B is approved, 20% discount and then you go to the third indication and you are coming in the last line with increasing the clinical value 40% and the number of patients is very low, and the competitor is very expensive. So, no discount, unless you go to NSCLC, that we know that in first line is immune-oncology, very expensive; and you are cheaper because you are coming after two indications... It is difficult to speak in general, we need to go case by case. 
I recommend sequence 1.  
[What if going for indication A to B was a 60% increase in volume. What type of change to the net price they would expect with a 60% increase in volume?]
We need to see the clinical value with the comparator.
[Lets assume that the standalone potential for the second indication and the first indication are about the same. Does that help?]
No, with 60% increase in volume you need to assume that you are going to reduce the price at least 30%. But 30% is not a bad discount, but it can be more than 30% if the clinical value of the price of the comparator is very cheap so it can go from 30 to 50. 
The problem with this discussion is that there is no a guideline in Spain.  Remember the excel file that I showed to you, that I made this cost-effectiveness analysis? It is very easy, I give you the answer to the price, cost effectiveness. I can not give you an answer because there is no guideline. I can tell you that I know because I was I the committees, I know the criteria is additional clinical value, additional number of patients, but we (inaudible 01:21:35) case by case. It is not the same to go to third line than go to first line. Because, in first line, if you go to a target population, probably there is a small number of patients, and normally in first line you donâ€™t have a lot of additional clinical value. In some cases, you go to third line with a small population and very high additional clinical value.",DAI475

There is the national decision making with the MoH that you negotiate the price and reimbursement for Spain but then there are the regions the communidades autonomas that pay the bill. That is important because that is the context we need to work within in ES. Usually I will be referring to the national negotiations, so the national perspective. Yes the pricing commission would be interested in the eligible population as per the authorisation by EMA but of course in the evaluation assuming you are familiar with the Spanish system there will be an IPT produced, informe de Posicionamiento TerapÃ©utico are you familar with those reports? oksy so  you know how it works and then you will see how it would fit within the current paradigm and in a asense implicitly the budget impact which is very important throughout the whole process. So to answer your question in a sense Yes we are interested in the marketing authoriazation population we will see however how the recommended treatment paradigm fits within the EMA authorization which usually will be more restrictive and then wihtin the budget iimpact calculations then the negotiations at national level the companies will have to produce a three year budget impact model very simple straightforward but with explanation adn there it is the real number or patints being treated, whether it is 54 27 200 or 600 or whatever , whether it is 2L 3L all these things we have especially for aGC, whether it is 2L or 3L the ministry would want to see certainly the numbers per 2L 3L so you know it is a bit of mix.

Is that off label use [esmo guideliens] Oh i think I am mixing it up with lung cancer. okay that is fine for the 2L. going back to the trial so i mentioned the asian population and then the comparator again i believe it is okay in the IPTs I don't know if you have seen the IPTs before but also very important I always say existing IPTs set a precedent in terms of the evaluation of new medicines for the same indication so I have identified two for aGC which are the two I sent already. one is 2015 one is 2021 because it is important because you will find information about the prevalence numbers which i also used to say to response to the first question of the form but also to look about what is used as comparators, the SoC, the type of poplatuon that is expected and funded for and also very importantly the gains in OS of current treatments that have been evaluated that is where I say that here we are talking about an advantage of 4mo OS for 3L,  for 2L is 12mo but that is absolute because there is no comparator so in 2L there would be the net effect would be less than the 12 mo as I said before in 2L we are talking about 12 mo against 8 10 mo so it is only an additional 2 mo. anyways so I say this because for product x the additional 4 mo are going to be deemed as modest, 2 months were deeped as very modest so i am assuming 4 mo will be deemed as modest and then thinking about the budget impact and I will link and the pricing and reimbursement then we need to take into account 2 facotrs here, one is the actual budget impact so the course treatment 44k the range to put 44k to 11k times the number of patient that will give you the budget impact  and then we can discuss later and that will be one driver and the second driver will be the cost effectiveness and we need to fo the maths very straightforward maths let's say at 44k per treatment and you get 4 extra months then per year you have to pay the 44 times 332k or whatever 130k EUR per year. so that is going to be high agin so that is going to give you a benchmark for the pricing discussion later which links to product x in GC but also in LC and it relates to any product you know at the end. so to summarise in terms of the trial design you need to check how applicable the inclusion criteria, the comparator, and the design and the asian population are to the ES population and  you can check the comments in the IPTs for the SoC and the trials from the other drugs that have been authorised and learn from the comments on previous studies in terms of the endpoints in terms of the that is how I know that 2 mo was deemed very modest from the other IPTs. so that is on the one hand and then in terms of the calculations you can think of the budget impact on the one hand and the cost effectiveness on the other. I guess that is my initial reaction to your question.",DAI475
24,11.c,"[any data that could help, show that baseline charateristics the same ] That would be heloful. I would argue that in the dossier when you explain the population of trial a there would need to be a section on the applicability to the ES poplulation again assuming that ES is a key priority country not by assumption which you dont have to confirm but I am assuming. so you would need precisely as you say can you show that the charactristics of the Asian or there are other studies not by the company but by other companies or academics that is showing in this respect whether there are differences between Asian and caucasian populatuon for instance. And then likewise for the inclusion criteria as well you will need to make sure that the population at the end going back to the first question about the target population and the eligible population at the end whether the target population that is going to take the medicine is comparable to the inclusion criteria because if it is not then the IPT will say that the evidence is weak. [you want to make sure inclusion criteria and trial matches patients that receive it in real work] well i would argue that you would need to check and if it is not 100% overlap which is probably the case then have a section in the value dossier rationalising discussing how different it is or whether there are no differences and then it is relatively safe and you cna use the data from this trial to extrapolate to ES.",DAI475
24,11.d,"[4 mo as modest, would they consider other measures han OS] Well they will always say they want hard endpoints and critically it is OS based on a ph3 RCT and that would be their ideal and anything that deviates from that always gets some comments about the evidence and the uncertainty so that is the first point and the second point will be with that in mind yes the preferred option is OS but they will see other less hard or proxy variables PFS being one because more or less it is a good proxy for OS. And then QoL etc. but then again if you look at the benefit in PFS it is even worse it is only 2 months. So i am assuming that in those 4 months you live extra 2 mo I have the time you are without progression and then in your 2 extra mo I am assuming your QoL deteriorates quite bad in the last 2 mo out of 4 mo. I am putting that in context as I've never been a payer never managed public money but working with them  think that is part of the problem so yeah [QoL valuavle?] I tend to say that QoL is a nice to have but it is not essential. Without any OS gains and just relying on QoL data will probbaly not be enough but if you have some decent OS and then you know having that the treatment is having that the treatment has some good impact on QoL in an area especially 3L where pronosis is pretty poor as you put in your materials and it says in the IPT it is a percentage but it is significant it is important number of patients that actually go to 3L and here I am focusing on 3L for now . there is an unmet need lets not forget it but it has to be put incontect with everything else that payers have to fund in a tough environment . and can I just ask we havn;t discussed anything but safety. (trial a more) There is some safety 55% vs the 85% correct so there is more important adverse effects correct [] those are the more severe or the less severe? [the more severe] and then also discontinuation 15% vs 5% again so if we think about the value story here it is only 4mo out of which half is no progressio plus more severe adverse effects plus more discontinuation so I am going to assume the QoL is not going to be grat of these people with this treatment again i think before we even discuss about price expectation although you already have a really useful slide. ... And the budget impact slides at the end you know you have to bear that inmind that the pricing expectations should be aligned wit reality and actually I was talking today with a journalist about all this not this product but aout pricing of medicines and managing expectations. On the one hand payers not just focusing on the short term budget impact I want the lowest prices around te workd please but also companies being a bit more mindful of the tough budget decisions that these guys have. Remmeber budgets are not integrated, they have a pharma budget and if they overspend in mo 6 they are in trouble. It is tough so I am not saying, it is always challenging and I try always with this type of work to not be critical but just to be reflective with the numbers at the end if I see these numbers my reaction is 4 mo, not great QoL, be mindful of what you are going to ask for please.",DAI475
24,12.b,"[comments on trial b] It is interesting that for 2L it is single arm  but for 3L it is randomised open label  because I would argue that for 2L there are more treatments available so again if you look at the IPTs thye say 2L blabla there is this treatments as you say also from the guidelines and there is already OS of what I don't remeber exactly but it was 10 12 mo or 8 10 mo so we are bringing in a product with a trial that is not great in terms of deviating from theor gold stanadard of a ph3 RCT with an active comparator and you see OS 12mo, PFS is still 5.5 mo and this is absoute so we need that without product x people would still get some OS with existing treatments. If we think about okay Safety seems to be like in trial a with physician's choice with irinotecan and paclitaxel although there is still higher discontinuation. It is another difficult decision [SAT design consider justifications? unmet need? delay in conductiong RCT speed to market?] I mean it is short answer is no I mean they still the gold standard will be a ph3 RCT with an active comparator talking about relative efficacy. anythign that deviates from that it will raise eyebrows then again if it is an area that is considered with extreme unmet need, ultra orphan, with really really poor prognosis, no treatments available, then okay speed here is an issue so it moght not be thical to have an RCT with a placebo but still i don't think this is the case that is why I say if it was a rare disease for kids then this kind of single arm study can be used and then they potentially will be included in (cannot make out 27:45) or whatever because it is high budget impact and they will e monitored and measured with real life data. One of few drugs that would get into this program but I don't feel like from what you have sent me and what I have read it's payers would be willing to pay such a huge budget impact effect based on this data. That would be very unease in trms of the incertainty.  [ITCs] yes and you can also use some kind of world data but again with the mantra with the deviation from the RCT as  well to be repetitive, but again it is a very good question because at the end there is always a tradeoff  etween and I am actually writing a paper as we speak about how can real world data help balance or help s this pathway or gap between efficacy and effectiveness without RCTs so certainly RCTs cannot prvide all the solutions for the payers. so there is a reason to deviate from the RCT but and then anything and they will be using the grade system to grade the different data and the studies in the (?) and whatever observational, so  they will be grraded and they will discuss this type of study. what I am saying is based on many IPTs read  if it is seen as a note of a high unmet need is those types of studies would not be the IPT would probably say oh we dont really recommend it or we recommend it after 5th line or whatever, it will be restructed and then it would probbaly not get funded if he price is too high. if we think about the numbers for, the 44k the highest price you have on the slide, again depending on the numbers that might go beyond 20M per year and then you think do you do the cost per QALY simple discussion that we were discussing it is 120 130k, it is big money it is expensive and high budget impact. and now under the law there are 6 or 7 criteria which are not well defined or anythign but they are headlines the reasons for reimbursement or not reimbursement and there are many drugs which are not reimbursed because of I think is criteria 8 which is about budget impact, it has a significant budget impact and it doesn't deliver value for money it says [new law implemented now ] that is a good question it is all work in progress  in theory it should come out this year but I think there will probably be I am not a lawyer and I didn't study law but I think they might be publishing lower level legislation in the form of royal decrees while in parallelthey work on the higher law, so the royal decree is developing bits of the puzzle ut it is a very good question but I don't know I talk to people and I hear things but I dont exactly but it should come out. Bottom line is in principle the market could be quite different in 3 years time when this product comes out, or 2 years time it is a good point. and just to add if everything goes, there is a significant probability that the economic evaluation would be more systematicly and wider used and then for this product certainly I can see some kind of modeling or economic evaluation being required what cost per QALY or life year saved would need to be done with Spanish data",DAI475

24,16.c.i,2.5,DAI475
24,53,"[] Good point so This is my views of course. I would argue okay assume for now that there is no economic evaluation it would be curently done under today's and the IPT would be the clinical evaluation and then there is a section at the end that says whether the director general of pharmacy has decided to reimburse it or not and for what line of treament. so I would argue in terms of the clinical evidence it would probably sy very uncertain for both. no let me start first for t 3L there is some decent data assuming that it applies to Spain, assuming that there is at least some replicability of the population and inclusion criteria to the ES population, whereby the drug product x in 3L offers a modet increase in OS of around 4 mo and even more modest effect on PFS. morever there are some increase in adverse effects that should not be neglected so overall the use of this product x in 3L shpuld be used if all other options for 3L do not really work or are contraindicated and should be seen as a possible option in 3L treatment. nothing about prices currently. In terms of 2L I see the data is even poorer, bcause single arm, ph2, open label, single arm. the absolute effect of 12 mo is significant but we have to bear that of course this is an open single arm so this is the absolute value so in practice the patient would be taking somehting else so the net benefit is around 2 4 mo. at least true the PFS is  5.5mo but we will argue tat this is abolsute not relative hence i would probably say for 2L at this stage it is prossibly not recommended and should wait for 3L treatment it should not be given as 2L. if we think about the paragraph about the funding there could be two options depending on the price expectations of the company. there is the option one that says it wsa decided not to be funded and it is not funded even for 3L or it has been funded for 3L under some strict conditions whereby I don't know what kind of conditions but some kind of where as I was saying before other potential 3L treatments are excluded for medical reasons so it is seen proably as a last resort. That is how I see it I am not sure if it is correct or not. [3L after other treatments enforced?] well it goes back to how the hospital budgets works. increasingly you know because of budget impact if product x is really not seen as something really sueful hospital pharmacies make sure that it wil get complicated to get the hospital formualry and I am sure that oncologists have additional controls to prescribe this at 3L. That could be an option. Let's not forget also that we have been talking about the IPT but the regions also have their own hospital networks of what they cann HTA, are you familiar with it, Genesis? this might also go through and they might say likewise this doesnt really add much and then if that is the case it would be even more difficult to use it. bottom line is that if it is not seen as very useful and not very worthwhile dont you worry there will be restrictions to the use but if it is seen as something valuable and useful then there will be ways around it.   [restrictions for 3L?] that you've in a sense that you use i would say more efficient so cheaper options as 3L rather than this one. but again there is a big it is not like the elephant in the room but a baby elephant in the room at what price is this product x going to be priced at and I know you've got that slide but I think that will be very important. Can I just confirm that product x does not have an authorised indication before correct [yes assume that] so there is no existing indication",DAI475
24,66.c,"so short answer is that if you can show that it is applicable to the Spanish population that you are negotiate then yes because so it depends on what type of real world data you are collecting and for what purpose but if I am assuming it is about effectiveness [what is collected ] short answer yes you know it is not resource use, it is clinical data ultimately, i mean again the company would need to assess you know how comparable are the French patients with the Spanish patients",DAI475
24,68,"[any alternative access routes if not reimbursed in 2L?] i mean this is a controversial issue in Spain currently ebcause it is part of the ongoing discussion with the ES law, what do you do while a product is being negotiated and when it is being declined for reimbursement because there can be alternative ways, it can be painful not painful physically it can be painful in terms of the paperwork, and the funding and the and I guess th Spanish authorities dont like it when there is this extra notion in the press about patients having access offlabel to medicines because of funding. it doesnt look good for many people but yes there are alternativs at the end yes",DAI475
24,69,"So I think there are two dimensions which I have already alluded to. one is the budget impact and the other one is the efficiency, the cost effectiveness of the product. so we will take it in turns. If we think about budget impact which is critical, I mean there is no written rule that says if you go beyond xM EUR per year we will have to negotiate a discount but from discussions you know, previous work,  any budget impact of plus 20M a year and dont ask me why 20M because I don;t know but it seems to raise eye brows so that is the budget impact. and we know budget impact is price times volume so you can play around with your two variables price and volume. So that is the first critical factor for pricing. the second factor in terms of the efficiency is the calculation I gave you before. If this drug gives us 4mo at 20k per treatment you get 4mo so per year you would have paid 4 times 3 12 mo so 60k per year. So and then they would say the question is is 60k per year. so and then they would say and the question is is 60k too high or low per year, i would say it is high, then we dont have a threshold in ES like the have in the UK but some of the IPTs that contain economic evaluations tend to cite the 20-30k EUR per QALY threshold blabla but we don't know so this is all high in the air but what I am saying is the price I think that would not raise eyebrows would be anything that keeps with this kind of it is cancer okay but beyond 40-50k EUR per QALY would be difficult to sell plus also the budget impact so those would be the two pricing anchors that the company has to think about. the budget impact where you play with price and volume and the cost effectiveness where you only play with the price relative to the extra 4 mo you get for the treatment [think of price per course or month?] Well good point when I was talking about before I was saying imagine it was 20k pounds per treatment per course for the full treatment and you live for 6 mo and you paid 20k for those 6 months for those 4 months so what I would argue is that if you do the simple maths if the drug would ave given you 12 months you would have had to pay 20k times 3 so then the annumal cost per year of live would have been 60k EUR. So if we think about this graph and then we think irrespective whether we talk about the list or the net we can discuss this in a second. what you would be saying is those 34k for opdivo for nivo which is the course to find the cost effectiveness you would need to know  how many months do i get for that course. do i get 6 mo, do I get a year, with opdivo here it was around 6 or 8 mo  imagine then you would do the calculations. imagine it was for a whole year that makes it easier then we would know then that for 34k EUR you would get 1 year of life so the cost effectiveness of nivolumab woud be 34k EUR per life year. so that would be my calculations on the cost effectiveness. very straight forward. and what I am saying is hat if you are within a range of 20-40k EUR per year in terms of the cost effectiveness ratio should not raise eyebrows but if you go beyond 50 60 70k it will raise eyebrows and if you go beyond 100k that would raise even more eyebrows. so that is how i was thinking about the cost effectiveness.  [20-40k EUR per year that is etween 1.5 and 4.5k per month that matces up with upper estimate being opdivo and cyramza] yes",DAI475
24,79,"[] yes there has been cases In which follow on studies have been accepted as part of the evidence package and it is a good point a good reminder. so certainly this again in the whole grand scheme of things and repeating the point about this deviates from their gold standard of an RCT it can be helpful but again if you look at the benefit it is 2 months 2.2 months vs the comparator again just to put into context. side effects they seem to be a bit lower it is a bit better so this basically what I am saying this evidence can be helpful for 2 reimbursement but again the impact on PFS so it is not OS is going to be deemed as modest or very modest because it is only 2 mo so lets bear that of the OS is 5 mo okay sorry i got confused so it is a but less than 5 mo so lets say modest not very modest modest. The decision whether to reimburse it or not for 2L would probably rely on the budget impact as well you know.  [condiional approval possible] so bottom line is not systematically but there are some initiatives and one is called waltermed(?) and they have published a handful of pharmacotherapies where they report for some based on real-world data effectiveness results on some specific drugs that were included in this registry and they were supposed to collect real world data about effectiveness so there is scope for that and also at hospital level but that is another story so there could be at national level some compromise of collecting further evidence which would then be used to reevaluate the pricing and reimbursement. and this is something i know because he said the new person who is in charge of pharmaceutical policy in ES, prof hernandez(?), that indeed for some when there is high uncertainty both clinical and economical there could be this flexible arrangement where you as you say it is a conditional reimbursment, it is provisional and in 1 or 2 years you would review again but it is certainly not systematic, we dont have anything like the cancer drugs fund but we have something. [reimbursed contingent on reassessment of this data or not reimbursed and could be layer?] I guess the question is, just to understand the sequencing of events. Are we saying we already have this data from trial c or these are expectations [1 -2 year aftr] so this is going ahead and then it is an expectations that it is going to deliver 5.4 mo of our OS. So the question is you would say in your value dossier you got trial a trial b bla bla and we got an ongoing trial c and these are our expectations so then what I see could be and this is why i am asking about sequencing so I wcould see the possibility if there is an agreement on the price at the end between the payer and the company then there could be the possibility of saying we would review you know at least you have to give us these additional 5 months from this trial even though we should we need to talk about it so that is a possibility. so it gets reimbursed if you have agreed that this is an accepatbale price and it is reviewed contingent on producin this type of data. [paying back? threshold?] I guess you could have several options but ultimately there could be some kind of price volume agreements or budget cups or whatever in addition to so you make sure that, because in the end outcomes based agreements are tricky in Spain there are some but they are not systematically used so you have to bear that in mind as well. you would prbably need to show the results in 2 years time and show that it has actually delivered what it is supposed to deliver [wait to review for trial c or review and not reimburse or contingent reimbursement] but assuming it would already reimbursed in 3L? [yes actually answered my own question]",DAI475

24,89.a,"[perception] So my I didnâ€™t mention before I am an economist and I learn also as I from these interviews since I donâ€™t know about all diseases but what I do to prepare is I read the material you send me, I do my own research, I read the IPTs, the (canot make out 1:04:40), I look at do a bit of search of treatments, guidelines, etc,with that in mind thinking about aGC with this type of lung cancer I just say lung cancer is much more complicated than GC. It is much more genetics in a sense and lung cancer really doesn't mean anything, lung cancer, it is so complex and so different depending on genes etc so I just see here you know it is not only the expression pdl1 but also these oncolgenic drivers. so  bottom line what I am trying to say is and i am with you it is much messier and this is what actually I was thinking what we said before that I think in a previous slide you said that there is no treatment for her2 mNSCLC for 2L but as yiu see here there is already some pharmacological use in 2L so I was thinking is that off label or is that because i think you say in slide [difference to GC is trastuzumab her2 directed, in lung no her2 specific]",DAI475
24,90,3.5,DAI475
24,104,"[different dosing from ema label in trial 1 still valuable?] I think so because again going back to it is SA again open label SA 50 patients even smaller number of patients than before so again it is what d we have ORR 60% OS 16mo but SA but yeah so it is another tricky decision for the payer. again We need to think again about the two factors the price linked to budget impact and the price linked to the price to the cost effectiveness ratio. [given this package IPT outcome ] again could be given this evidence to be included as an option but not much more, but not saying not recommending it or anything specifically for second line maybe as some option but then whether it is reimbursed or not would depend on the price adn the budget impact. [what should price look like for reimbursement] so it depends on how the benefits of product x compare to the benefits of the alternatives you have here. because at the end the price of product x will somehow need to be aligned to this 20k-40k per year i think ultimately because they will do the numbers at the end so you know. [lower end?] I don't know exactly what is the value of these products in this 2L whether they give 2mo or 4 mo or 6 mo but I am assuming it is less than a year for these prices right [some get close to 10mo ] if we do the simple calculations as before. imagine we pick prembrolizumab and we stick to60k net price per course and imagine they give a year so basically we would be arguing that we are paying in Spain for pembrolizumab 60k EUR for one year correct? but pemrolizumab we know much more about pembro they got a lot of indications. what i am saying is with product x paying 60k EUR per one year would be possibly too high and would not get reimbursed at those prices. so it is not only thinking about the prices of the competitors but how it rates its price if you do the cost effcticeness calculation.  [matter of price acceptable and depend on indirect overall survival benefit from indirect comparators?] yes you can provide that furthre evidence in the dossier. and just to flag so you are aware it was also announced at an event last week or a coupe of weeks ago that the MoH is draftin some guidelines for manufacturers settng out what hey would ask of companies in the value dossier. again that is something you need to keep an eye on, because in theory that will tell companies what data they should submit, what is allowed, what is not allowed, etc. so again thinking about today vs in 2 years maybe in 2 years we have a clear view about the data that would be accepted and how it would be accepted. [price point] i mean it is difficult to say because we dont have any kind of liek the UK i would say well if you are anything over 30k pounds per QALY here you might have a difficult one. In Spain I would argue given the uncertainty around the evidence there would not be any willingenss to pay in ES any kind of price premium for the product, so I would argue anything that takes the product beyond 30k 40k EUR per QALY per year would be difficult to reimburse.",DAI475
24,148,"Short anserr is yes, log answer is it will depend on the type of uncertanty the payer thinks they are facing, whether it is financial uncertainty or clinical uncertainty, in this regard for this product x there is clinical uncertainty because of the type of studies generated but potentially there could be some economic uncertainty in terms of the number of patients receiving product x whether or not. so If we think that the uncertainty relies on the number of patients and we thin okay the clincial evidence is decent then the payer would want some price volume agreement or some kind of budget cup, but if it is more the uncertainty is about the clinical evidence they might request some sort of outcomes based which are much more difficult to implement of course. [population pretty small, outcomes based agreements coudl support reimbursement?] at the end at national level maybe at the end because you know in this walter med registry is not for all drugs as i say so we only have 12 or 14 medicines so it is true that given the low patient numbers and it is not included in this registry and then you would probably maybe for some regions they might be asking for some region specific. for instance catalonia has its own oncology institue where they negotiate for all the hpspitals in catalonia the risk sharing agreements for cancer oncoogy drugs and then all hospitals ashere to this risk sharing agreement but that is at a regional level. so that could certainly happen for this drug.",DAI475
24,157,"[new trial 1L help reimbursement in 2L] well if it shows, so 2 things, first of all in terms of the trial design that sounds very appropriate that would be the type of evidence that payers would like then so that is good. the second question is what are the effects of product x. is it 2 mo is it 4 mo is it 6 mo and then based on the outcomes and based on the price then there would be the discussion but without knowing the results the effects the actual numbers.  But of course we know that the results would have an effect because the design in theory is the gold standard so that would certainly be taken into account [support the initial reimbursment?] yes well I mean an rct that is good enough good approriate with positive important clincial effect in the clinical evaluation of the IPT will always get good comments, the design is good and we actually get important results and then the discussion about financing is separate in that then it will be agreed or not whether it is reimbured at the price they negotiated or not. so again they are two different things. just to clarify. so of course an rct properly defined and 10 good outcomes significant effects then that of course will get credit in the clinical part of the IPT which of course then helps in the pricing negotiation and funding of course. if your evidence is rubbish then the company will not have a very solid negotiation point. but if it is an RCT with approrpiate comparator and with good effects then it is a different story.",DAI475
24,162,"[] again short answer a price discount according to the budget impact and the additional patietns to be treated within the indication, there would be some price decrease to minimise the budget impact. that is what happens today that would be my short. then I know that there are some discussion in Spain to ty to do maybe something different with multiindication medicines so then what i would argue is that of course the indication a will set a key precendent for future prices for the future indications that if product x has different value for this indication i.e. maybe higher or lower than indication a then there could be some measn of i imagine indication b or the her2 for gastric it provides a lot of value more value than for indication a, whatever the cancer is ther could be some way of very difficult though as usually in most cases the price would go down because of budget impact, there might be some means to do something different or try to have some different net prices by indication but there needs to be some important difference in value across indications of the product x and last but not least my understanding is for payers they dont like uncertainty so whatever the plan is whatever plans the company is thinking it is also very minor the payer doesnt like uncertainty so for example in sequence 3 when you are negotiating indication b the company knows that the next 2  indications are coming up, i know some companies would say no i dont want to raise that okay fine but remember when you go back in a years time negotiating for the same product and you didn't tell them about the new indication they might be upset and then they might be tougher. that would be my reflection on the launch sequencing. [minimum disocunt] depends on at least 2 factors one what is the price already and 2 what is at the end the benefit of product x in her2 NSCLC because if ultimately it doesn't deliver too much and the price is already high even though it is a small budget impact at the end 200 patients times a hgih price is still importnat and if it doesn't deliver too muhc it might lead to a reduction in prices. so it is difficult to say without knowing the exact numbers but i mean i would argue the bottomline is to assume that they will be asking for a discount. [benefit of launching into 2 indications together?] I would argue it is better to negotiate at the same time if possibel that is my impression precisely because you have a bit more leway to play around and likelwise as i said they don't like nasty surprises so potentially again I think it could be better to have the two indications at the same time [from a to both of these increase 50-70% in terms of volume what discount expected] it is very difficult to say but if I would have to say a figure I would argue around a 20% reduction in expenditure, so if you re spending a 100, okay let's have 2 scenarios if budget impact is assumed ie the new indication is reimbursed but the payer doesn't want to pay any extra then the reduction in the price will be such that with the new volumes the total expenditure is the same, with the new indicaiton, so budegt neutrality can be a good threshold to do the calculations, what would be the expected price reduction. and after that then you can start thinking about okay if I put the price above this price that gives me 0 budget impact then i get an extra budget impact of 10M or 5M and then you know how to play around so that is how I would think about your question. [5M 10M acceptable?] again it could be acceptabe if the the outcomes you get are within the costeffectiveness is decent and the outcomes at the end make sense to patients. at the end the extra months are worthwhile. [last jump 2% of total pop ] assuming so again if it is relatively safe that it is indeed 2% and not 5%    or 10% then maybe, and assumign the effects in NSCLC are decent then maybe a 2% you wouldn't need any price discount. [any other thoughts or recommendations for sequencing?] no i think it is the first price sets a precendent, that is for sure, it is the anchor price that you have to play around that is why I was asking before whether there were previous indications or not, and to payers dont like surprises, financial surprises. That would be my final reflections I think which I have already said but I think nothing else to add  I think for now at least.",DAI475
