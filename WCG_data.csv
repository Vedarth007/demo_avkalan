"Conditional agreements based on product utilization: 

Patient caps (The total dose or cost per patient is capped â€“ units consumed beyond the cap are provided for free) 

Duration-based contracts (Price per patient is reduced or increased over time or at specific patient milestones (e.g. price in the first four years of treatment is $100, after which it reduces to $80)) 

Cost-sharing (Manufacturer pays for the drug costs in the initial treatment phase. An alternative is paying for HRU costs (e.g. hospitalisation) during initiation. Usually administered through rebates) 

Price/volume agreement / revenue cap (The price of the product is agreed on for a pre-defined volume of sales, beyond which a discount is applied.
